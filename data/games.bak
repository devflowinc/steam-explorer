        "detailed_description": "Super Toy Cars is a tabletop arcade combat racing game featuring fast and cool looking cars, impressive tracks made of everyday objects and a bunch of power-ups that will let you destroy your opposition. Collect all cars and upgrades to keep up with competition while you progress in career mode or have a quick race either against AI opponents or against friends. You can play up to 4 players locally and up to 8 players online. Go and build your own tracks, share them with friends or play with them in your tracks. Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for you to tinkle and play with, but most importantly this game has been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either alone or with friends. There are 16 different cars in the game each one with its unique handling model. You can experiment with them and play the ones that best suite your driving style and the different situations you'll find in our 12 tracks. Oh, and maybe you'll want to use different cars depending on which type of event you're playing, because we have 48 events in career mode, but not all of them are races! And if you grow tired of the tracks in the game you can always check what other tracks have the community built or even build your own and share it with our in-game track editor. Features: 16 different cars with unique handling models 12 different tracks in 4 different locations which can be played in 5 different event types Career mode comprising 48 events Up to 4 player local multiplayer Up to 8 player online multiplayer Track editor to build and share your own tracks Early Access Roadmap We have a roadmap in place for the period the game is going to be in Early Access. We are aiming for a final release date in the first or second week of May. We have roughly 10 weeks to that date and we're planning to do, at least, weekly builds with improvements. We'll be announcing what's new in every build in the announcements section, but anyway here's the planned roadmap: March, 3rd: Mostly bugfixing and online improvements. Possibly some improvements in the HUD and menus. March, 10th: Improved menus backgrounds, improved HUD, better and more consistent AI accross the game. Achievement icons. March, 17th: More effects and particle systems. Bugfixing. March, 24th: First batch of vehicle paintjobs. April, 7th: Mac version. Second batch of vehicle paintjobs. April, 21st: Linux version. All vehicles have, at least, 2 paintjobs available. April, 28th: Some easter eggs, and other bonuses. Maybe provide a first alpha of a vehicle editor. Bear in mind that this list is meant to change and adapt to your suggestions and feedback. Although we can't guarantee we'll implement every detail and suggestion we receive, we'll do our best to react to community feedback and make of Super Toy Cars the best game we can with your help.",

Who says a great RTS has to be a big budget studio endeavor?&quot; -- Tom Chick, Quarter To Three &quot;Infested Planet is a game I’m excited to see evolve, as it has the potential to be a unique and engaging RTS unlike any I have played before.&quot; -- Nightmare Mode &quot;Infested Planet is already quite fun, and the current beta is being very actively expanded, refined and tuned. If you’re into strategy, this might well be worth keeping an eye on. After all, who knows what it could mutate into?&quot; -- DIY Gamer &quot;The mutations are an ingenious way to mix each game up and keep the experience fresh.&quot; -- WarGamer",

        "detailed_description": "Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience. The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war&quot;. Ambush --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",

He’s going to use every tower in his arsenal to protect them: Arrow Towers, Cannon Towers, Anti-Air Towers, Ice Towers, Laser Towers, Fire Towers, Tesla Towers, Mortar Towers, special power ups and more! There is also the mysterious Tum-Tum island , that randomly generates levels for near infinite replayability!

        "detailed_description": "Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game inspired by the developer's actual battle with mental illness. In the game, you take on the role of Thomas who awakens from a terrible nightmare only to find that he is still dreaming. As he descends deeper through the layers of hellish dreamscapes, he must hide from horrifying apparitions and outrun his inner demons. He must discover which of the horrors he encounters are a manifestation of his own psychological state and figure out what reality will be when he finally wakes up. Terrifying nightmare worlds inspired by real life struggles with OCD and depression. Black and white artwork creates a distinctive moody and dark atmosphere. Branching narrative features 3 completely different endings. A dynamic lighting system gives the ever present darkness a character of its own. IGF nominated composer Skyler McGlothlin delivers a haunting and oppressive dark ambient score.",

        "reviews": "“Neverending Nightmares falls into the must-play section of the horror genre. Whether or not you find it scary, you’ll definitely be disturbed and intrigued as you seek resolution to the madness.” 4.5/5 – GameRevolution “Neverending Nightmares is an excellent display of psychological horror that is as thought-provoking as it is terrifying.” 4.5/5 – TwoDashStash “By the time I was done with Neverending Nightmares, not only did I have a great scary time, I felt like I understood a little bit of what Gilgenbach and others struggling with the illness feel on a daily basis. Make no mistake, it's still a horror game first and foremost, but that extra little bit of dark knowledge is unsettling. The terror feels more real, more concrete, than any other horror game I've played in recent memory.” 7/10 – Destructoid",

        "detailed_description": "Explore, craft, and survive in this Multiplayer RPG Platformer with permanent death! Featuring many Rogue-like elements, Magicite randomly generates each underground dungeon for you and your friends to delve deep into. Chop trees, mine ores, and hunt beasts in order to collect the resources and materials you need to survive the harsh and unforgiving environment. With a ton of character traits, stats, companions, and classes, players will have a different experience each play through! Be prepared to die... A LOT. Magicite's main influences were Monster Hunter and Spelunky. I loved the resource collection and crafting in Monster Hunter, and of course fighting giant monsters with my friends. Spelunky's brutal yet rewarding platforming was also something that I wanted to capture with Magicite. Features: Randomly Generated Dungeons - Experience a new dungeon each time you play. Expect tons of trees to chop, ores to mine, plants to harvest, and bugs to catch! Oh and giant monsters.

        "about_the_game": "Explore, craft, and survive in this Multiplayer RPG Platformer with permanent death! Featuring many Rogue-like elements, Magicite randomly generates each underground dungeon for you and your friends to delve deep into. Chop trees, mine ores, and hunt beasts in order to collect the resources and materials you need to survive the harsh and unforgiving environment. With a ton of character traits, stats, companions, and classes, players will have a different experience each play through! Be prepared to die... A LOT. Magicite's main influences were Monster Hunter and Spelunky. I loved the resource collection and crafting in Monster Hunter, and of course fighting giant monsters with my friends.

Players must fight their way through hordes of varying enemy robots while exploring intricate levels to uncover their mysterious past and discover the true enemy. Within the galaxy on the Carina arm live twin solar systems riddled with conflict: the Terrius system and his brother, the Cyrinus system.

However, the Cyrians have become embroiled in an interplanetary conflict with the Glortac People’s Resistance. Terrius has begun building military installations in order to better help combat the threat of the GPR. One of these bases, built on the planet Valiant, has been sabotaged. A terrorist has released thousands of killer robots on the Valiant base, destroying all personnel. The Terrius military has determined that this terrorist may have contacts with the GPR. Due to the risk of one of their most powerful military installations and armory falling into the hands of the GPR, Terrius has sent a strike force of 100 advanced KR drones to destroy these evil robots and restore order to the base- all before Valiant makes it’s swing into the Cyrinus system.

        "detailed_description": "Creeper World 3: Cellular automata takes over a strategy simulation. Instead of discrete units that attack your base, a fluid-like substance spreads over the terraformable terrain. Your base, your weapons, your strategy... you must adapt them all. Creeper World 3 bends what it means to be a strategy title. Instead of heavily scripted A.I., players find themselves engaging an enemy with theoretically predictable behavior yet which is shockingly interesting to engage. Players can build fortifications and stick around forever. Players can go for domination, quick strategic kills, or amass huge stockpiles of resources. Some play for speed, others to create art. Tiny maps, large maps, five minute missions, five day missions... the simulation scales to handle all of these scenarios. User generated content is critical and supported at multiple levels in Creeper World 3. Dial up worlds using the DMD (Dial Map Device) and tweak dozens of constraints. Then, play and share the addresses via an on-line database. Create your own maps using the built-in map editor and upload and share on-line. Or, join with thousands of other players and peruse the databases of worlds created by others. Want to create a new weapon, a unit, an enemy, or an effect? Use the built in scripting language to create what you dream. Hundreds of engine commands are exposed and examples abound on the forums and grow daily. You can even take the built in story maps and make your own. In fact, all of the built in story missions were written using the built-in editor and the CRPL scripting language. Some of the high level features are: Thermodynamic/fluid physics based play. Billions of total missions. Story arc with insane and unique enemies. Explore hundreds of star systems with thousands of worlds in Prospector missions. Hundreds of hand crafted missions in the Alpha Sector. Dial up your own mission worlds using the 'Dial Map Device' and share the address. Create your own maps using the included map editor. Play on maps of variable size, dimension, and shape. Script your own enemies and effects using the built in scripting language. Terraform the landscape during missions to take the higher ground. Discover experimental weapons that devastate the enemy. Share thousands of unique maps with an established, enthusiastic on-line community. Features a unique, original, and awesome soundtrack.",

        "detailed_description": "You awake from a terrifying nightmare to discover that your home city of River Lake has been devasted by an explosion at a neuroscience laboratory. A dangerous biochemical has been released into the ecosystem, turning every living thing into a bloodthirsty killer. You are holed up in your apartment; for all you know you are the last survivor but your food and water supplies are running low. It's time to take your chance and make your move. You must use your wits and your brain to avoid dangers, solve puzzles, find your girlfriend - if she is still alive - and escape the broken city... Search for items and use them in different scenes. Fight infected zombies to stay alive. Point and click to find objects. Multiple endings Full soundtrack written by David.F.Burrows. Every action you take will have it's consequences. Be aware of trigger effects. Exciting storyline that will keep you searching for the truth. 25th June, 2012 Dear Jenny, I don't know where you are but write you this letter in the hope that you might return home. Water and food supplies are running low and I have to leave Riverlake. I haven't slept in what seems like ages - I try and shut my eyes but I keep hearing strange noises outside. The streets echo with desperate screams and it's too dangerous to be out for long. There are crazy people running around, attacking anyone in sight - it's like they are infected with some sort of virus. I watched one of them stand up not long after he was shot multiple times in the chest. It's surely only a matter of time before the infected come bursting through the door here. None of it makes any sense. I don’t know how this all happened but I do know that I'm not safe here. Where is the military? Are they even around any more? I don't know what's going on and in the city I am totally alone. I am certain you are still out there somewhere, I can feel it. I want you to know that I will wait for you... Do not think that I am leaving you - you are and always will be with me and my love for you will be forever. If you read this I will have made my way out of here. I will wait for you at the gas station just a few miles out of town. I hope I can be there tomorrow evening and I will wait for a week. If you do not show up I will be heading north, to try and find someone - anyone - who might have survived this. Forever yours.

It seems fate has other plans for him, however, as a pirate captain named Ladoc makes him an offer he simply can't refuse: a chance to explore a dangerous, uncharted archipelago in the Atlas Ocean that may hold treasures of heretofore unseen value. Never ones to back away from a good mystery, Adol and Dogi both agree to join Ladoc on this expedition aboard his ship, the “Tres Mares” -- but no sooner does it weigh anchor than the Romuns, their sights set on the same curious islands of Canaan, attack the wayward pirates and ultimately knock Adol overboard, leaving him for dead. Some time later, he washes ashore in Canaan itself, alive but weakened, rescued and resuscitated by two young girls named Isha and Olha who sport long ears and bushy tails. They are of the native “Rehda” tribe, and it seems Adol is not the first human to arrive here -- nor are humans particularly welcome... Come experience the very first 3D Ys game as you've never experienced it before! Already the foundation upon which Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin would later be built, this version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim comes equipped with an original translation and brand new, entirely unique gameplay features such as the addition of a super hardcore “Catastrophe Mode” for fans of the later titles, full widescreen support, map warping, Steam achievements and leaderboards, and even a full digital art book packed with concept sketches, hi-res character portraits and original production PSDs. See what you've been missing with this definitive version of the game that brought Ys into the modern era! Key Features: Fast, real-time combat centered around elemental swords with unique magical abilities Enormous screen-filling bosses set to quintessentially Ys rock music composed by the legendary Falcom Sound Team jdk A deep and involving story that ties into Ys history and serves as a cornerstone of series lore Brand new “Catastrophe Mode” where healing items can’t be purchased or stored, to create a gameplay experience more in line with later entries Adjustable high-resolution PC graphics and gamepad support Newly-added ability to warp among checkpoints Steam achievements and leaderboards",

        "detailed_description": "Echoes+ is an intense retro action space shooter created with App Game Kit 2. It will test your reactions and concentration levels to the max! Fight your way through wave after wave of neon coloured space enemies, leveling up your score multiplayer and shields as you go. The onslaught just keeps on building with new challenges the further you progress. You'll need to be super focused if you want a place on the global high score table, one blink and it can be all over! Echoes+ is a showcase game made using App Game Kit 2 (AGK). You can learn more about App Game Kit 2 here: / Echoes mode Echoes mode consists of 10 levels of blasting action, each introducing a new enemy with different strengths &amp; weaknesses. When you get hit you lose energy but it can be replenished by collecting green power ups. Getting hit may also downgrade your weapon, but act fast and you can power it back up again. Increased kills means more power-ups. Time Attack Just want a quick blast? Then try time attack. In this mode you have to score as many points as you can in 3 minutes. You get unlimited energy but being hit incurs a points penalty. Tips The secret to a high score is collecting multipliers. The more enemies you kill the more multiplier power-ups will be dropped. Shooting stars will always drop a score multiplier. Warning! Points lost if hit are linked to the score multiplier. Survivor Mode This is all about how long you can survive without taking a hit. The score is irrelevant! Tips Your weapon will power up over time automatically. Time is your priority so shooting enemies might not always be the best approach. Destroying planets might be risky but they drop shields which will protect you for 10 seconds, invaluable in this game mode. Classic Mode This has a simpler game play and modified controls making it more like the 80's retro games. Tips Use smaller and more controlled movements than in other game modes. Try and stay away from the edge of the play area whenever possible. Listen out for the warning sounds that mean a saucer is approaching. Meteor Storm Mode This challenges you to fend off increasingly frequent and dense waves of meteors. Destroy the golden meteors &amp; collect score multipliers. Tips Your ship starts with a fixed amount of energy which cannot be replenished. Getting hit reduces your energy but also causes you to drop some of your score multipliers. Your weapon power is fixed and cannot be increased. Asteroid Belt Mode Here you face snakes of energy that increase in both quantity and length at each new level. Tips Your ship starts with a fixed amount of energy which cannot be replenished. The score multiplier is linked to the number of asteroid belts at the start of the current level. Your weapon power is fixed and cannot be increased. Zoo Trials (zoots) These are a series of additional challenges. Each zoot can be attempted on any of the four difficulty levels, with harder difficulties contributing more towards your total completion percentage; Easy = 1%, Normal = 2%, Hard = 3% and Insane = 4% Only the hardest difficulty achieved counts towards your total, so for the ultimate 100% score you need to complete each of the 25 zoots on insane difficulty. Zoots can only be completed in specific game modes so make sure you check these on the zoo trials menu screen. The Pause screen shows your progress towards and zoots. If you enjoyed Echoes+ then you might also like 1982! /",

Therefore, I designed this ARPG battle system which requires no attack button to play. The simplicity brings a fluent and interesting gaming experience. Eternal Senia is the realization of this concept. I spent one year developing this game. It is a game that can be easily enjoyed by any player. ●Characters: Heroine Senia has both her name and the outlook from 'Ygnizem Seniar&quot; in Ragnarok Online. Senia's sister, Magaleta, also originates from a foe &quot;Magaleta&quot; in lighthalzen dungeon of Ragnarok Online. Ragnarok Online is, to this day, still my favorite game of all time. EtneralSenia is a non-profit making game solely based on my enthusiasm for RO and gaming developing. I wish Eternal Senia can bring up the memory of classic MMORPG Ragnarok Online to all players who participated.",

Manage a clan of colourful Dwarves, establish an epic mining operation, craft legendary swords and delve deep for greater glory, riches... and danger. Sheltered 2 - Out Now About the Game Panting, scared, the shelter airlock smashes down behind you. You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do. It would be easier to give up. But you don’t. The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. “Daddy you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times. In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube... Sheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”. Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future. With all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you'll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying. Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter. You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your families survival for just one more day. Feature List Family comes first : Keep your family alive and protect them from the ravages of the harsh post-apocalyptic world. Make the shelter a home : Maintain your shelter - keep it secure, habitable and make sure that the family have enough resources to survive. Protect your shelter from hazards and infiltration! Customisation : Your family is unique to you; you decide their gender, names and their appearance. RPG mechanics : As your family develop, their stats will adapt with an evolving experience and trauma system. Attributes, strengths and weaknesses will dynamically change based on your choices. Crafting system : Create comforts for your family’s shelter and weapons for combat. Exploration : Send out your family to explore and gather resources for everyday living and crafting. Recruitment system : Recruit outsiders with different personalities, integrate them into your shelter life and earn their loyalty. Dynamic encounter system : Your family will encounter various threats including roaming factions and feral beasts. Turn-based combat : For those that cannot be reasoned with, violence can be used as a last resort. Your family may depend on it. Pets : Your pet is family too. Choose between the dog, cat, fish, snake or horse. Vehicles : Make exploration quicker and safer.",

Your tools are your lightning-fast shadow walk, the powerful glyphs you find, and the magical skills that you upgrade along the way. Your reward for survival? Unspeakable power and a chance to uncover your true fate.

ABD: A Beautiful Day is an MMORTSS (Massively Multiplayer Online Real Time Survival Strategy) that spans from 100,000 B.C.E. to 245 B.C.E.. Play in this 24 hour, 7 days a week continuous environment to build your civilization, and fight exposure in the process. Work together or work alone, and task your minions to do your bidding while you're gone! Inspired by Gaming Epic's like Empire Earth, Age of Empires, Supreme Commander, and The Oregon Trail, you will embark on an epic journey for survival that spans the ages. As a player, you will contribute to the progression and stories that encompass the era, the era around you, and the direction of the game as time moves forward. It isn't one rain drop that initiates a flood, its many thousands. •Anticipated Rating: M for Mature. •Post-Launch Agenda: E for Everyone version. •24 hour, 7 days a week continuous game area. •100+ Square Kilometer Map + Infinite. •Holiday Events. •Units work while you're away. •Men, Women, and Children. •Historical accuracy. •Unique Technology system. •Unique Crafting and Equipment system. •Diverse Economy. (W.I.P.) •Full Dismemberment. (W.I.P.) •Many, many more features. Players will battle exposure, infection, a lack of technology, and hardships that can cast the environment into a dark-age. Each Tier involves something called a Paradigm Shift, a Formal Paradigm that encompasses the epic of the era. Epics are stories that societies tell themselves that encompass their world views. These Paradigms are in textual form, which advances both on an individual player level and reflects globally across the game environment. For the July 15th Release, you will play through the First and Second tier, receiving further tiers as we progress through the refinement process of our Work in Progress release. Unlike most Tier/Era/Age based Real-Time-Strategy games, we're moving away from 'set' timespans. When you enter the game, you'll have primitive technology to begin with just like everyone else regardless of global progression. As you expand, you'll unlock further technology to aid you in your travels. Instead of having this 'set' timespan, players will have a unique experience every time they enter a server. For instance, if Server A is more aggressive, a dark age will be incurred. If Server B is more cooperative, technology and trade will be abundant. On Server C it could be a mix of the two, with certain regions in constant conflict and one or two superpowers in the far off distance. Also, you progress individually, but can work cooperatively and form alliances or guilds. ABD plays out like any other RTS, except this time, cooperation and unity is your best bet for survival. The days of killing everything and everyone are over, you'll need each other to survive. Not only that, you'll form developmental relationships with your civilization. Sending your minions in to die will have an effect on you, emotionally immersing you into the experience. The introduction to Women and Children is important, otherwise the 18-32 male only demographic makes players remorseless to their actions in games. You will absolutely encounter ruthless players, but this feature will unify the gaming community in the conquest for the greater good to triumph the evils of the almighty player.",

Great and terrible mysteries and even greater treasures await if you are bold or foolhardy enough to go beyond the beyond. The Bizarre World of Deathstate In Deathstate, you are a traveller of the outer realms. You have discovered the secrets of deep astral projection by entering into a fully death-like meditative state. While in your Deathstate, you can go beyond the beyond to realms previously only imagined by those enlightened or mad enough to dwell upon them. Tread lightly though, for these far planes of demi-existence that you choose to explore are extremely hostile to mortal souls.

Worlds full of painstakingly pixeled environments, enemies, and bosses will warp and shift before your eyes as your mind becomes subjected to the chaotic influence of the warp.

You will discover arcane grimoires, mystic weaponry, burial masks, and gem encrusted idols. Most prized are organs dropped by Elite enemies and Bosses. Through these organs supernatural powers become yours, allowing you to push your character beyond the limits of mortal power!",

Awesome!” 8.5/10 – GameCritics",

The more battles you fight, the cooler your mercenaries become, the faster they run, the better they shoot, and (most importantly) the more abilities they learn – abilities that can dramatically change the course of the battle. Use attribute points and carefully choose your equipment to match your mercenary to your unique playing style. Play on your own and join random battles.

In Skirmish mode, simply kill your enemies and protect your allies to gain victory. In Capture mode, you also need to capture and defend control points. Clan tournaments. Every few days, tournaments are held to determine the strongest clan! More Info About A Mercs 5 mercenary classes are available in the game: stormtrooper, scout, sniper, medic, and robot. Each merc has his or her own skills, weapon, and playing style. John the sniper, armed with a sniper rifle, deals immense damage to his target at a large distance. The sniper can also cover an ally who is under threat of being attacked. Lira the scout, on the other hand, uses subterfuge and cunning. She's a scout and saboteur who can sneak up on the enemy's rear quickly and unnoticed, revealing the enemy's position to her allies and weakening and wounding him before nimbly hiding herself from his retribution. Her weapon is an SMG. Next is the robot Bobby, a universal battle machine with a tough metal hull and armed with a machine gun. Bobby has two modes: defensive mode, where he can cover allies with his powerful shield, and attacking mode, where he turns into a weapon of mass destruction. The medic is an essential unit on the battlefield. Her name is Leto, and she's not afraid to take aim at her allies – with a syringe gun full of healing nanobots or a stimulator that can refill action points. An efficient medic can make a good team unstoppable! Last of all is the stormtrooper Greg. He is a tough guy armed with an assault rifle. His job is to break through the enemy's ranks, deal them damage, interfere with their activity, and all the while survive enemy attacks.

But little is known to the Governments, because we, humans, are not the only beings interested in this mysterious cyborg.

As your journey goes on, these weapons and skills can improved and evolved to help you defeat stronger enemies. ========= FEATURES ========= UNIQUE ENEMIES There are three types of enemies in The Admin which are : The Wildlife Creatures, The Solar System Government's Spec Ops and The Xenotroops. Each of them has 5 types of variations with unique appearance and distinct strategy to defeat them. • The Wildlife Creatures These are dangerous wildlife creature that inhabit the planet where the hidden research facility is located. The size of these creatures varies from the small annoying maggot to the giant apex predator. And each of them will have different way to take down its prey. Like the spinger spitting acid or the basraptor charging its prey. • The SSG Spec Ops In this era, human civilization has spread to dozens of solar system under the Star Systems Governments. Yet after visiting more than one hundred planets, humanity had never met another intelligence life forms. To keep these dozens of solar systems safe, the SSG had a very reliable armies. And the one that is feared the most by pirates and separatists is the SSG Spec Ops, which members are all highly trained soldiers. Even there are genetically enhanced super soldiers among them. • The Xenotroops On the other side of milky way far from the reach of human civilizations, there are another civilizations way bigger and more advanced than the humanity. Most of these alien civilizations united as one big alliance and have spread to countless of solar system. One of them is the Xenotroops, a race of space roaming warriors equipped with very advanced weaponry ready to annihilate everything that is threatening the alliance. MULTIPLE WAYS TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER Because of the ever growing threat that is ready to destroy The Admin and all his works, you will need more deadly weapons and skills to survive. The gun and sword can be upgraded to become more deadly physical or energy weapons type. This energy or physical type will have more advantage against certain type of enemy. Just like the weapons, the skills can also be upgraded and evolved. Each of the skills in the admin can be evolved into one of 2 branches available when you reach a certain point. Each branch will have a distinct function and properties than the other one.",

Play as The Admin, a cyborg wielding gun and sword in defending the research facility from humans who try to reclaim it and from other beings try to destroy him. ====================== GAMEPLAY OF THE ADMIN ====================== This game is a single player 3rd person action adventure game where you play as a cyborg called The Admin. As the only thing that left in the facility, he must keep the facility running and defend it from anything that is threatening his mission. You will have 2 weapons, a handgun and a sword, and some skills that can be used in your battle against the enemy. As your journey goes on, these weapons and skills can improved and evolved to help you defeat stronger enemies. ========= FEATURES ========= UNIQUE ENEMIES There are three types of enemies in The Admin which are : The Wildlife Creatures, The Solar System Government's Spec Ops and The Xenotroops. Each of them has 5 types of variations with unique appearance and distinct strategy to defeat them. • The Wildlife Creatures These are dangerous wildlife creature that inhabit the planet where the hidden research facility is located. The size of these creatures varies from the small annoying maggot to the giant apex predator. And each of them will have different way to take down its prey. Like the spinger spitting acid or the basraptor charging its prey. • The SSG Spec Ops In this era, human civilization has spread to dozens of solar system under the Star Systems Governments. Yet after visiting more than one hundred planets, humanity had never met another intelligence life forms. To keep these dozens of solar systems safe, the SSG had a very reliable armies. And the one that is feared the most by pirates and separatists is the SSG Spec Ops, which members are all highly trained soldiers. Even there are genetically enhanced super soldiers among them. • The Xenotroops On the other side of milky way far from the reach of human civilizations, there are another civilizations way bigger and more advanced than the humanity. Most of these alien civilizations united as one big alliance and have spread to countless of solar system. One of them is the Xenotroops, a race of space roaming warriors equipped with very advanced weaponry ready to annihilate everything that is threatening the alliance. MULTIPLE WAYS TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER Because of the ever growing threat that is ready to destroy The Admin and all his works, you will need more deadly weapons and skills to survive. The gun and sword can be upgraded to become more deadly physical or energy weapons type. This energy or physical type will have more advantage against certain type of enemy. Just like the weapons, the skills can also be upgraded and evolved. Each of the skills in the admin can be evolved into one of 2 branches available when you reach a certain point. Each branch will have a distinct function and properties than the other one.",

This was done, so that worthy mortals could appeal to the Jade Emperor and obtain divine powers, to aid in the search of his missing daughter. However, this gift was exploited and taken advantage of, causing chaos in the mortal realm. The Nine Li Tribe became a cult that worshipped demons and practiced in the occult, divorcing themselves from the businesses of the mortal realm. Forces of evil suddenly arose, inciting wars across the continent, condemning people into a life of fears and sufferings. Emperor Zhuanxu feared the demon Chiyou would once again ravage the mortal realm. Limited by his own capabilities, he sought the help of the Queen of Huaxu, who once assisted Xuanyuan the Yellow Emperor in warding off the Otherworld with the Bell of Donghuang. Both Fuxi and Nuwa—the children of the Queen of Huaxu—also supported Emperor Zhuanxu in convincing the Queen, for they too could not bear to watch people suffer any longer. In the end, the gates to heaven were finally sealed with the powers of the Divine Artifacts combined. Since then, no mortals were able to ascend, nor were gods able to descend at will. This incident was later recorded down in history as “Juedi Tiantong.” Features: This latest entry broke new grounds in comparison with previous titles in the series, including: the new lighting system that better establishes moods, creating various atmospheric scenes; as well as facial animation and lip-sync systems, MVN motion capture system to elevate the quality standard of all characters in every aspect. These new technologies not only improve visuals but also game immersion, enabling the players to fully comprehend the behaviors and feelings of the protagonists. The battle system has been replaced with a real-time, encounter-based gameplay mechanism, making the battles more intense than ever. Improved returning features exclusive to the Xuan-Yuan Sword series include: the Urn of Spirit Infusion that enables demon-synthesis and equipment refinement; the Guardian System that allows your captured demons to fight on your side; and the Miracle System that grants additional attack buffs. A new “Battle Formation” system is also introduced in this latest entry, allowing for a richer and better gaming experience for the players.",

In the game as you walk through the path, you see the visions of a woman and read the notes she leaves to you. But sometimes you need to do some things and figure out how to reach her. Additionally in the game you can do a few exploration if you prefer. There are some things to be found away from the path. As you progress, you hear some nice piano tunes as well as the sound of the soft wind. Also the sound of shrubs moving and some animals. Those are things that make the game more atmospheric. The game is sometimes mystical, sometimes funny, sometimes scary but mostly relaxing. After you complete the game, another mode called 'Noir&quot; is unlocked and with it you play generally the same game but with another atmospheric black &amp; white filter and it is night time. Also in Noir mode there are some surprising differences. Note: The orbs you collect in game give you temporary speed boost. PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.",

        "detailed_description": "PLEASE WISHLIST 🙏 / About the Game WARNING: This is a text game and requires a lot of reading. Introducing the latest, proper interactive fiction game from CoaguCo Industries. Story 4 is now out and Story 1 is now free! The last story of the series has finally dropped. Follow Aloysius as he witnesses the end of Marsch's tale, the beginning of Madelyn's, and finds out what really happened to Dr. Stansfield. Also, Story 1 is now available, in full, for free. Click the demo button to get it! You are about to uncover four twisted tales of misadventure surrounding people connected, in some way, by the late Dr. Cyrus Stansfield's cloning machine. Within these stories you must face the ethical dilemmas and possible fortune while guiding each character to their own end. The story takes place in the city of Starkham; the same location as One Way To Die and The Dope Game , and features recognizable places and characters spanning both games. Owners of previous games will get alternate story chunks unlocked as well. In the proper fashion of text adventures, the player starts a story and navigates by making decisions at certain times to move forward. Each decision has a variety of outcomes and consequences, many of which have randomized elements to them. Before the start of each story, the player is given the opportunity to change various elements about the story, similar to Mad Libs. These changes will move forward with each story as the player progresses. The game comes with four stories which are released in episodic fashion: Story One The Addict follows the nephew of Dr. Stansfield, Marsch, after he gets out of rehab and inherits his uncle's mansion and lab. Will he fall back to old habits and ruin this opportunity or will he take advantage of it and finally improve his life while continuing the family legacy? Story Two The Doctor reveals exactly what happened to Dr. Stansfield leading to his nephew taking over. How did he die? Did he even actually die at all? Story Three The Neighbor follows a little girl, Madelyn, who stumbles into the lab after it has been condemned following the nephew's untimely mistakes. She also falls victim to the cloning machine and must not only clear her good name but stop her clone from doing further damage. Story Four The Clone is about Aloysius, one of the clones who survives Marsch's failed experiment, who tries to make sense of everything that happened since then as well as unravel the mystery of Dr. Stansfield's death. The game launched with story one, The Addict, with the additional stories to follow as episodic updates. The game also keeps track of various statistics, both personal and global, such as decisions made, random events encountered, and wins/losses over games played. Progress on each story's branches is also kept so the player can use it to experience all the different outcomes for each one, if they choose. There are also a total of twenty-five achievements broken up among the stories, five each, as well as five global ones.",

Take a break from reality and explore an animated psychedelic sculpture park. Wander through the labyrinth, soar across the open space, or just hang out and let the mesmerizing ever-changing sculptures provide a rejuvenating refuge for your mind. Blortasia combines art and flying in virtual reality. Blortasia is a virtual reality art experience designed to engage the imagination and inspire wonder through shape, color, motion, sound, and spatial presence. Instead of recreating art from the real world, Blortasia explores virtual reality as an aesthetic medium in and of itself. Rather than telling a narrative story like a movie, or presenting objectives, puzzles, and challenges like a game, Blortasia transports you into an art installation unconstrained by the limits of ordinary reality. Features • Innovative Physics based VR navigation makes flying in Blortasia easy and comfortable even for most motion sensitive people. • Blortasia's flowing designs provide a constantly evolving environment that's always unique. • Hypnotic soundtrack fuses ancient and modern sound healing techniques. ​ • The abstract nature of Blortasia inspires the imagination through pareidolia. • Psychedelic boogie board platform provides spatial reference and stability for surfing through Blortasia. Flying is simple and intuitive. Point the controller where you want to go and squeeze the trigger to accelerate. Use one controller or combine them for increased speed and maneuverability. ​Low, medium, and high speed modes and analog triggers provide smooth and precise control. Explore the space at your own pace. Blortasia is created by artist and Academy Award winning visual effects pioneer, Kevin Mack. Mack's work is inspired by transcendent visions, technology, nature, neuroscience, physics, and artificial life.",

There's also a certain trickster and third wheel named Yvin who ends up following them around. He's not a thief, but he'll steal your heart in the most awkward way possible, hopefully. Warning: Contains mild blood. Features: 3 routes with 11 CGs total Approximately 4-6 hours long total Made as a straightforward visual novel with no need for a guide An obligatory childhood friend Unsolicited puns",

        "detailed_description": "Peter Taylor's wife is dead. One day he decided to take a vacation abroad. He arrives at a small, quiet coastal town where tourists are sparse and everybody knows each other. It's only when he notices people are going missing and all the signs point to a dark, mysterious island out to sea that he decides to team up with local journalist Michelle and terrified-yet-adventure-seeking waiter Glenn to go and investigate. What secrets does the island hold? What are the locals hiding? And what's causing those blood-curdling screams that seem to be coming from that mysterious island in the dead of night? Calm Waters is a 2D classic point and click thriller/mystery/horror influenced by the likes of Lost and Twin Peaks. Calm Waters features: - Professional voice actors - Full 1080p HD 2D pre-rendered backgrounds - Intriguing characters - An immersive story full of twists and turns - An atmospheric soundtrack Apart from the voice actors and music, the entire game was created by myself over the space of 6 years.",

The only way to restore magic to the kingdom is to find three hidden artifacts: The Coconut of Quendor, The Cube of Foundation, and The Skull of Yoruk. Join forces with Dungeon Master Dalboz who calls you &quot;AFGNCAAP&quot;( politically-correct initialism for &quot;Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person&quot;) and together you travel throughout the Underground Empire's many locations, such as Hades, Flood Control Dam #3 and The Dungeon Master's Lair in an attempt to find the three missing artifacts and bring about the fall of the Inquisition. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is the last installment of the famous Zork adventure series. It uses the same formula as its predecessor: first-person perspective, 360 degree camera rotation, pre-rendered backgrounds, and live actors. Humor and comical pop-culture references accompany you throughout the entire game and guarantee that you will never get bored. So if you are looking for a not so serious oldschool adventure then this gem is for you. Stunning graphics and enchanting music absorb you into over 30 unique 360⁰ environments Live action video and voice acting by stars such as Dirk Benedict, Michael McKean and David Landerr Visit the famous landmarks that made Zork legendary.

Plant your seeds anywhere - there are no rigid plots or grids. It's a sandbox experience where you are free to do as you please. Work towards a series of increasingly difficult achievements or simply grow a beautiful garden and admire the view. Features planned for the final version : Care for your plants by providing proper surroundings, water, and nutrients. Explore your MiniVerse filled with floating islands and organic, fractal structures. Discover dozens of bizarre plants and critters. Defend your garden from invading pests and weeds. Collect alien artifacts. Earn Achievements by completing fun challenges. Don't forget to sample to fruits of your labor. Gravity Garden is still in an early stage of development. There are about a dozen kinds of plant to care for, a few critters to observe, and a small world to explore. Not much actual 'game' in there yet, though. You can get a good feel for where the Garden is headed and help shape its progress by offering feedback and suggestions. I'm a solo game developer so every bit of feedback I get is very useful. I'm excited to hear your ideas and suggestions for the Garden. Check out the Community Hub for release notes, to-do lists, feedback, and suggestions Requires a SteamVR compatible headset. Not yet tested with Windows Mixed Reality or Index Headsets, but should work with standard button mappings. Conversion to the new SteamVR Input system is on the to-do list which will improve compatibility. A strong CPU and GPU will let you grow up to a thousand plants at once. A min-spec VR system will probably struggle after 50 or 100...at least for now.",

You can explore a massive randomly generated galaxy, Interact with alien factions, Battle massive enemy fleets and even take command of a fleet yourself. Resources can be collected throughout the galaxy to upgrade your ship and its abilities. The story is lighthearted yet dark, filled with plenty of lovable characters and genocide. There are also many secrets in the galaxy of SuperCluster: Void, all waiting to be uncovered by one valiant adventurer who has nothing left to lose. Fight for your people, explore the galaxy, and fulfill your destiny, in SuperCluster: Void. Quests and Exploration SuperCluster: Void allows you to explore your own randomly generated galaxy. There are hundreds of different solar systems for you to explore with their own planets and moons which can be explored to complete quests or gather resources to upgrade your ship. Some of these planets are common and contain common resources such as copper or steel. Others are rare and contain valuable resources such as diamond or uranium. Resources and Crafting Resources you collect can be used to upgrade different parts for your ship or buy a new ship entirely. You can craft weapons, armor, thrusters, and many other upgrades for your ship. Combat and Abilities SuperCluster: Void has many unique alien factions to interact with. Some of these factions will be hostile and attack you while others will work with you and assist you on your quest. Your primary weapon is your ship's guns. These have infinite ammunition and a high rate of fire but relatively low damage. Your ship has a limited number of missiles as new missiles must be crafted from resources you have collected. These missiles have high damage and seek out enemy ships. Finally, your ship has certain upgradable abilities. These abilities are very powerful but have long cooldowns. A few of these abilities include Radial Burst, Quick Regen, and Rapid Fire. These abilities can be bought and upgraded through the use of 'Science&quot; which can be collected by completing quests and leveling up. Commanding your Fleet SuperCluster: Void allows you to command your own fleet of starships. Adding a ship to your fleet will cause it to follow you around wherever you go and fight with you. You can upgrade these ships to increase their shield, hull, and damage or rename the ships in your fleet to whatever you want.",

        "reviews": "“Lots there for fans of VHS flickering and garish colours. It’s inspired by Twin Peaks, Zelda and Monkey Island, says Madrid-based creator Jacob Jazz, which is an odd soup to bring to the boil. There’s a flavour of Undertale and Space Funeral to it as well, of course, but I don’t know if that’s the developer’s intention. It also features “psychedelic Russian surf music” and the turn-based combat includes the option to “Spit”, so that’s a plus.” Rock, Paper, Shotgun “An eccentric experience mix of Twin Peaks, X-Files and some kind of burlesque. Watracio Walpurgis, our hero, has a bright future ahead.” 7,5 – IGN “Jacob Jazz's Baobabs Mausoleum is Batshit Crazy, But You'll Want to Play it Anyway.” GameSpew",

        "detailed_description": "In London, 1729, before they had police, they had you: thief-takers, hunting criminals for cash! Fire a flintlock and sip gin in the age of powdered wigs. Will you grow rich catching smugglers and highwaymen, show mercy, or become a crime boss yourself? Trials of the Thief-Taker is a 140,000-word interactive historical adventure novel by Joey Jones, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. As a thief-taker, paid by the court or hired by the victims of crime to recover property and, for an extra price, bring the culprit to justice, you'll stalk your prey across the misty commons and narrow rookeries of 18th-century London. Lead a gang of unwashed ruffians (or stalk the streets alone) as you apprehend highwaymen on lonely roads, and root out crooks and counterfeiters in inns and coffeehouses. Through cunning, force, or suspicious connections, you will find your mark. You may strike a blow for justice, making a name for yourself and bringing good people to your cause. Or you can create the crimes you intend to solve, stealing the goods you'll be paid to recover, bribing prison guards to let your associates go, building your criminal empire while everyone lauds you as a hero. Be quick or cautious, proper or disreputable, generous or mercenary...it's all in a day's work for a thief-taker. Load your flintlock! There are thieves to take. Play as male, female, or as a woman disguised as a man; gay or straight. Make your way through a world ruled by manners, harsh laws, and lurking treachery. Run an empire of crime or establish the first police force...or both at the same time! Capture, befriend, or romance corrupt officials, escape artists, courtiers, highwaymen, smugglers and grave-robbers. Immerse yourself in Georgian lingo: learn the difference between a cove and a swell, a blue pigeon and an ark ruffian. Play the high-stakes dice game Hazard in the gaming houses of Covent Garden. Make your way with your silver tongue, a good horse, your street smarts or with two fists flying.",

Tears stream from your eyes and the race moves into extreme speed. Tears of sweat. The same stuff that's seeping off your palms and onto the steering wheel. Get a grip. You're sliding into a turn at 200 miles per hour and centrifugal force will only carry you so far. This is velocity-driven, pedal-to-the-metal arcade racing. Strapped into a personally chosen made-for-the-Autobahn racing machine, you'll scream to redefine fast in this winding 3D ride of pure fun. Great, addictive, arcade-style gameplay Driving mechanics so unrealistic they’ll make you wish you could powerslide like that in real life! If you didn’t have a Pentium processor back in 1995, now is your chance to finally play this game!",

        "detailed_description": "Thrilling like a payday, a story of cats in funny costumes that do RPGish things. It is full of many unexpected and incredible twists, the tragedies of an individual lured into the trap of an adventourist internship, and friendly pastry, which is very sensitive to nihilism. The game also contains many thrilling conversations, walking around the map with some logical puzzles sprinkled in here and there – but don’t worry, even a liberal arts student should be able to solve them – raising pastry, and deliberations about important moral and existential issues, the majority of which will affect the ending you get. The ending will sum up the fates of the most important characters, in-game achievements, your proficiency in fighting the ultimate bad guy, your finesse in raising pastry and the degree of faith in friendship. This results in dozens of possible ending combinations. After completing the game, you can try NewGame+ to unlock additional, normally unavailable skills for the main character. The world of Nyanya Nyanya is an enormous cat world that can take up to 20 hours to fully explore. The main plotline itself is good for more than 8 hours of fun, but the game also includes many side quests found on numerous maps, hundreds of interactions with NPCs and over a thousand descriptions of nearly everything. You can also find dozens of exciting items such as the legendary Excalipurr and the frightening Berserker Catnip. The role of the majority of animals is played by various kinds of rolls, which, together with cats, pidgins, and sneks, constitute the entirety of Nyanya’s fauna. Kibble is found in mines and on can triis, almost all buildings are boxes (because cardboard boxes are cats’ natural habitat) and cleaning fur is a matter of importance to the state. The sense and logic of this world are therefore highly debatable... But don’t worry about its coherence. We made sure that it is top-notch. All this mess is watched over by cat gods, such as the mysterious Great Bowl of Goodness – a giant stone leg, whose calf disappears in the clouds, Meowrida the Brave – goddess of shooting, and Overcat – the creator of everything that's feline. The game is produced in a retro jRPG style. Party The protagonist of the game is Catair, a meowsassin, who is as optimistic and sweet as sandpaper. When she sets out on her amazing journey, she has the chance to discover friendship, love, and revenge and to travel through many wonderful lands that she does not want to visit... And yet, she has no choice. She will join the party led by the veteran of the war in Furajevo – Francat the clericat. Their adventourist paths will cross with Purrgli, a yes-cat and an outstanding purrior, Catniss – a fighter for friendship and even more friendship, as well as meowmage Meowdledore, whose parents bought him gifts instead of giving him some attention. You can meet them here . Combat The game features tons of epic turn-based jRPG fights, where you will have an opportunity to use dozens of such unique cat techniques as Boot to the Head, Slipper Comet or a Hairball of Darkness. The characters represent traditional classes such as meowsassin, meowmage and purrior. With their powers combined, they are able to face adversities such as student internships and unpaid overtime. Among the dozens of opponents, you will find monstrosities such as orcats, aggressive cat fetuses enchanted in slime, or Purrevar, Prince of the Underpurr. What is more, The Chronicles of Nyanya is probably the only game in which you can charge Nazi furniture on your rollicorn or fight their mysterious Wundermöbelwaffe. Parody and pop culture The game is filled with familiar-sounding places and names. If you love comic books, memes or just pop culture in general, you will feel right at home in Nyanya. You will meet Cateris, talk with Granny Weathercat, Furry Catter and Nyoda and listen to the moving stories of Catmerian guards, who always wanted to be adventourists like you, but they took an arrow to their knees. In other games, references are Easter eggs, in Nyanya they are the main course. Creators The game was created by hamstercube studio, made up of Ilona, author of chatolandia and Adrian. The graphics were created mainly by Revv, known from her Tak bardzo źle blog; Ilona also had something to do with it. The moving music, which tickles your aesthetic sense was composed by Marcin Maślanka, an experienced composer of soundtracks for games and films.",

        "detailed_description": "GLO at the PLAY Expo We had a great time at the PLAY Expo in Manchester showcasing Glo. Loads of gamers came to test their skills racking up over 6000 deaths during the weekend! Well done to everyone and thank you for all the amazing compliments! About the Game What happens in a game where most of it is hidden? Glo is a puzzle platformer where the majority of the world is hidden. Using blind faith, glowing projectiles and memory use your skill to escape each room. Provoked by writing on the wall the story unravels as the mystery of the environment is revealed. Story Tormented by the unknown environment and messages on the wall that give the feeling of being watched, Glo is found in a strange world where everything is covered in darkness. Using whatever light can be found and blind faith, Glo must try to find a way through the darkness to unravel the mystery and escape this nightmare. Features 100 challenging levels. 4 epic boss fights. Precise controls. Speedrun mode. A world shadowed in darkness full of secrets. Pure abstract visuals designed to stretch the boundaries of imagination. Atmospheric soundtrack blended with the environment and story to build a world of emotion. Glo is a one of a kind experience that takes you on an emotional story of curiosity, wonder and fear. Glo combines the environment and story as one allowing you to reveal everything from nothing. In a world where nothing is known, everything is a surprise.",

Glo allowed me to exert my gaming chops with its enticingly brutal difficulty, something not many games can do now-a-days... Exhilarating challenge.” 7/10 – Keen Gamer “Hell of a lot of fun to play... Masterful level design.” PixelJudge",

We thank you sincerely you for supporting us at this stage and being willing to take part in the vibrant community that helps shape Unknightly and build it into one of the finest stealth games VR has ever seen. Short Background Story Unknightly is a medieval VR stealth game designed from the ground up for virtual reality. You assume the role of a retired master-thief as he is drawn back into a life once thought left behind, to come to the aid of an old comrade, in the eternal tale of greed-fueled and power-starved men seeking to impose their will upon the masses, regardless of the cost. VR: Stealth First This is first and foremost a stealth game, so there's almost always multiple ways to solve every challenge. Using combat to eliminate guards is viable but not mandatory, and might not always be possible! Instead, you are encouraged to think through different situations and find ways to get around unnoticed, steal valuable items, and get out without being caught! Stealth and Cunning? Move around you will have to sneak past guards and climb walls. Walk around in shadows and avoid areas with a lot of light to stay invisible even when walking close to guards. Be careful not to make loud noises to avoid making guards suspicious. Throw objects around to distract guards and create a window of opportunity for you to execute your plans! And more... The Experience &amp; Choice Choice in how you approach each and every level. There is always more than one path to the objective. Scout through technically challenging and visually compelling environments in search of valuable objects. Feel the tension creep up on you as you realize that every mistake could be fatal.

I’m loathe to call it a game as it really goes far deeper than that... you’d be silly not to give it a whirl.

What could go wrong? Fight against the faceless enemies with whatever weapons you can get your hands on! Three different ways to Rage: Free Mode: Demolish hapless dummies with any weapons you can. Choose from the basic weapons to start and gain enough credits by destroying dummies to unlock bigger and messier tools of destruction. This sandbox mode is all about playing around and doing whatever you want. Story Mode: Begin at ‘Facility 12’, a testing facility for different weapons as well as the most effective ways to deliver pain. You begin with basic weapons such as bats and clubs, then move your way towards more devious weapons such as crossbows and bubble guns. Be warned some of the dummies have been exhibiting sentience and aren’t too keen about being destroyed for the sake of science. Frenzy Mode: Choose between frenzies that showcase various weapons types in Rage Room. If you ever wanted to be a Ninja *of course you do* well here’s your chance! With 7 different frenzies to choose from, race against the clock to destroy the dummies. You can also customize your dummies with 32 different accessories.

        "detailed_description": "The Apartment - Psychological Thriller Game The Apartment is bringing together quite unique mix of genres. Combination of first person detective action-adventure game, psychological horror with some interesting puzzles and action-packed FPS finale, all tied together with dark and heavy story. It is not a pure horror and it's not just a story adventure either. The Investigation As detective James Sachs, you lead the investigation of several murders in your area. Young girls were found dead, arranged and with strange injuries that don't make any sense. It's up to you to find out who these girls were. Why were they killed. And find the murderer before he strikes again and solve the case. Case that might prove to be more difficult and challenging than you ever imagined. Main gameplay of the action-adventure part focuses on detective work - exploring crime scenes, finding evidence, connecting clues, completing simple word puzzles or physics puzzles and piece together the whole story. Not all evidence on the crime scene is crucial for finding the killer. There is also a lot of wrong choices you can make, wrong questions you can ask. So you will need to pay attention and think about your actions. Before your investigation ends up in a dead end. The Nightmare Horror part of The Apartment is focused more on psychological horror, rather than jumpscares or survival horror. There is no monster hunting you down, there is no threat that you can see (but don't worry, there is still lot of way you can die in this game). The main purpose is to create unsettling and eerie atmosphere and make the player as uncomfortable and creeped out as possible. Why? What is your goal? Survive? Win? Escape? No matter what is happening, you can only be certain of one thing now - nothing makes sense anymore. There is no clear line between 'investigation&quot; and &quot;horror&quot; parts. You can never tell what is waiting around the next corner. Both worlds of reality and nightmare are slowly fusing together. But is there even such a thing as reality anymore? The Apartment is very diverse in its environments. Don't expect single, unchanging surroundings. This game is switching scenes and environments faster than you would imagine. Always trying to keep one step ahead of the player. Path forward is often blocked with simple, yet interesting puzzles. Word puzzles, number puzzles, simple physics stuff, but also some play with light and shadows. Total gameplay time is 4,5 - 5,5 hours and the main story culminates in grand, action-packed finale. NOTE: Solving puzzles is big part of the game, so be prepared for that. Basic understanding of English might be required for some of the puzzles, so keep that in mind.",

        "detailed_description": "Story In the dark depths of a prison cell sits a mythic being, stripped of his powers, all but forgotten by time. Neither man, nor beast, but closely resembling parts of both. A one-of-a-kind being, known only as Krampus. Once a being both respected and feared, serving as the personal right-hand-man of Santa Claus, but also as his opposite. While the mission of Santa Claus was to reward the good-hearted children of the world with gifts, Krampus on the other hand was to do the dirty deed of punishing the wicked children. The world was in balance. But one day, Santa in all of his saintly wisdom had an idea, a change of heart. He no longer wished for the wicked children to be punished, but rather have all children be rewarded equally. Krampus, for the first time in millennia, spoke up with his disagreement. But Santa Claus would not have any insubordination, and immediately had Krampus thrown in a cell and his hook removed. More than a century has passed since then, with Krampus growing angrier and angrier for every day spent imprisoned, patiently waiting for the day he will walk free. That day has finally come. When a mysterious stanger throws Krampus the key to the cell, the tides has finally turned, and the day of reckoning is here. With his soul-bound chain of punishment, Krampus must swing, jump, and fight his way up the snowy mountains of the North Pole, and in the end, enact his vengence upon the one who put him in that dark pit. Santa Claus. Gameplay Krampus Quest is a back-to-basics retro-style action-platformer with a christmas theme. You go from one side to the other, fighting enemies and bosses, absorbing souls, dodging traps and pitfalls, and upgrade your abilities. There is some exploring and backtracking, but mostly this is a straight-forward kind of game. Features include: Controller support and Save files. Glorious 8-bit pixel graphics. Catchy chiptune music. Jumping, walljumping, and swinging platform ACTION . Exploring levels to find upgrades and souls. Buying upgrades and sub-weapons with souls absorbed from fallen foes. Dramatic still-frame cutscenes. Short but sweet .",

        "detailed_description": "Having ended up on an abandoned remote island you find yourself in a life and death battle against the evil coming straight from perdition. Enter a terrifying multiplayer horror experience featuring sessions for up to five players, where any one of them has chance of becoming the bone chilling demonic entity that will try to slaughter the rest of the group. Daemonical is an asymmetrical horror multiplayer game in which a group of people find an unfinished demon summoning ritual. With the demonic entity released upon the island, the players must find a way to send it back to hell or end up slaughtered. Never knowing which one of them has become possessed by the demon, it is their decision to make on if they want to team up and trust each other or try surviving alone. The humans are played in the first-person mode. In order to exorcise the demon, they need to find the missing ritual components and bring them back to the alter. Their only alternative is hiding and surviving until the dawn, when the sunlight will purge the demon from the grounds. They can use fire, which hurts the demon, or weapons and tools hidden around the island to their advantage. While the demon can’t be killed, he can be crippled, stalled and distracted. The demon is played in the third person, needs to simply slaughter all the humans and prevent them from finishing the ritual. He is fast, agile, powerful and deadly. The humans are stronger when they band together, but they are easier to find. Stay together or split up to avoid ending up in a group with a demon – it is for you to choose. Will you go for the missing ritual parts, or just try to hide until dawn? Will you help the others, or just be a lone wolf – the game leaves that up to you. When a player dies in the game, their soul gets separated from their body and they can float around the map in the shape of a glowing ball of light. He can light the way for the players, and find the demon and follow him so the others can see where he is. Daemonical also features a positional voice chat, so you can tell the other players that are close to you your plan, or pick a strategy together, but be careful! The demon might be listening in. Customize your character – pick your gender, choose between various player models, clothes, colors and symbols that you can put on your clothing. Key Features: Asymmetrical multiplayer First person and third person playing mode Dynamic time of day and weather system Most of the map is procedurally generated Tools and weapons randomly placed across the map Big open landscapes Positional voice communication Fully customizable characters Interesting locations and landmarks Nonlinear gameplay The most terrifying hide and seek experience in gaming Scare your friends, or get scared with your friends!",

Recruit heroic characters to aide your cause and dominate your enemies on military, technological, political, and economic fronts. Will you build powerful friendships, form brotherly alliances, and earn the respect of your many foes? Or would you rather commit acts of treachery, inflict heart-wrenching betrayals, and become a master of grand political intrigue? Your legend is yet to be written, but one thing is certain: glorious conquest awaits. ANCIENT CHINA RECREATED Discover Three Kingdoms China, a land of breath-taking natural beauty. Battle across lush subtropics, arid deserts and snow-capped mountains. Marvel at legendary landmarks like the Great Wall of China and the Yangtze River.

GUANXI SYSTEM Modelled on Guanxi, the Chinese concept of dynamic inter-relationships, Total War: THREE KINGDOMS takes a paradigm-shifting approach to character agency, with iconic, larger-than-life heroes and their relationships defining the future of ancient China. Each of these characters is brought to life with their own unique personality, motivations, and likes/dislikes. They also form their own deep relationships with each other, both positive and negative, that shape how your story plays out. ARTISTIC PURITY With stunning visuals and flamboyant Wushu combat, THREE KINGDOMS is the art of war. With beautiful UI, vibrant vistas and authentic Chinese-inspired artwork, this reimagining of ancient China is a visual feast.

The game is impossible after all, unless you can prove me wrong. Enjoy all 10 'Impossible' levels. You can choose these levels in the main menu! This is my first ever game. When I started this project I had no experience making games. I followed a bunch of tutorials and made Impossible Runner! This was a passion project, that's why I'm releasing everything for free.

        "about_the_game": "Impossible Runner is all about running and jumping! The goal of the game is not to complete every level, it's about having fun! The game is impossible after all, unless you can prove me wrong. Enjoy all 10 'Impossible' levels. You can choose these levels in the main menu! This is my first ever game. When I started this project I had no experience making games. I followed a bunch of tutorials and made Impossible Runner! This was a passion project, that's why I'm releasing everything for free. Please do not expect a AAA, flawless experience. Many things might be missing in the game and you'll maybe find a few bugs here and there. Just know that everything was made with love and passion and this won't be my last game!",

Do you want to take off from the football pitch and take to the skies with your drone? ...to flank the low-gravity ball into the opponent's goal with daring kicks? Football and drones collide in GAME OF DRONES. It is a minimalist mini multiplayer game with a reduced, futuristic look. Who are the developers? We are a small Bavarian startup located in Munich and have developed the game with dedication. The scope of the game is very small and it is the first game we are launching. GoD is not a triple-A game with lots of content. Please take this into account when making your purchase decision. We want to provide you with a small multiplayer game for LANs or online. Through the drones the soccer game gets another dimension - kicking from the highest heights. Due to special physics the ball moves with less gravity and can be shot into the opponent's goal. GoD has put us into addictive states while playing. If something doesn't work with the game, please write us directly. We will answer as fast as possible and help you if there is a fire. You can also write us if you had a great time with Game of Drones. Send us recordings of your best hits. Game of Drones offers you: Drone soccer mini multiplayer Easy control 1x drone, 1x football arena Low-Gravity Ball and good physics of the drone Futuristic design with optical effects Fun in Multiplayer for in between with highscores Game of Drones does NOT include: Armed drones Real soccer players Cars (who does that ;) Loot boxes Career mode Tons of content (it is a mini-game, but with maxi-fun) Microtransactions Gameplay: Game of Drones is a very small, simple multiplayer game. You can choose in the menu between 1vs1 online multiplayer and 2vs2 online multiplayer. After choosing you can start the game and you will be beamed to the drone soccer arena. Now you see your drone in pursuit perspective and the match starts against your opponent. In the middle is the big, low-gravity ball, which you have to kick, head, bump, dig, ram or volley as cleverly as possible into the opponent's goal (either red or blue). After 3 minutes the game is over and the player with the most goals wins the match. After that you will land back in the lobby and can start a new game.

You must use your extensive training and deadly arsenal of weapons to contain the disease, whilst eliminating what’s left of the infected crew. ReFramed takes place in the same universe and timeline as Solarix but reimagined as a fast-paced, combat focused, FPS. Instead of exploring the research station as an engineer sneaking around to survive, you are now an extremely skilled soldier shooting his way to freedom. Key Features Intense, old school first-person horror shooter with 2000s style graphics and 1990s style retro-gameplay. Relive the original stealth-based Solarix story as an action-packed FPS. Decimate the infected crew members as you tear through the interstellar research station as an unstoppable soldier trained to kill anything and everything. Utilise an extensive arsenal of epic weapons, such as Sniper Rifle and Rocket Launcher, all brand new to the Solarix universe. Storm through 11 stunningly crafted levels such as Surface of Planet Ancyra, Mines and Remora Space Station. A pulse pounding action soundtrack to keep you pumped as you lay waste to your infected foes A suspenseful sci-fi horror narrative that acts as a backdrop to your ruthless killing mission.

Macfield and the Island of Memories -&quot;. Despite the horrifying death traps across the mysterious island, J.J. is able to revive from death endlessly. Many traps and gimmicks can be overcome only by bringing harm to your body, such as being struck by an iron ball, or by dismemberment. Be wary of your surroundings and look for ways, conventional and unconventional, to get through the island. You may need to use your limbs as weight, or even break yourself in two to get through smaller spaces. Sometimes you can find tips by sacrificing your own body through dismemberment, being crushed, jumping into fires, and more. But don’t worry as you can revive yourself as many times as needed to find your way through the island. J.J. scours Memoria Island to find her best friend, who has gone missing during a camping trip. However, this island was like a nightmare: no matter how many times she sustains fatal injury, she couldn’t die, and instead is able to revive herself back to normal. J.J. ventures into the depth of the island as she drags her decapitated body along, enduring the pain. Her limbs may sever, her neck may break, she may go through severe burns, but... In order to save her best friend, she puts her own body and life on the line, reviving infinitely, as she presses forward. Why did she go missing? What is going on in this world? All of these mysteries shall be revealed when the game is cleared.",

        "detailed_description": "The Story of Development August (AuggoDoggo) Yadon left his San Francisco programming job to move to Cleveland, Ohio and work full time on his first VR game. Almost all of the early development was streamed live on Twitch, where a small following grew. Everything in the game is made almost entirely from scratch in Unity3d, Blender, and Gimp. To read more about the challenges, success, and behind the scenes, read on our website. A Note on the Length of the Game A regular playthrough will last 45-90 minutes . A number of people have read the description and advised me to make more content to increase the length of the game, pushing it past Steam's refund policy window (120 minutes) . I've been working on this game for 3 years, and it's a comedic piece of art that I'm proud of. In the same way that a musician shouldn't add a few extra songs immediately before release, and why a director shouldn't do the same with scenes in their movie, I also don't want to dilute Plunker's experience by adding filler content just to hit a certain time requirement . I enjoy this goofy little game for exactly what it is . I'm ready to move forward and let the world play Plunker . About the Game Plunker is a short, and heavily comedy based indie VR game based on exploring for easter eggs and extremely goofy interactions with the world around you. The player investigates suspicious scenes, trying to find anything out of order. You can expect to be strung along by jokes, replayable VR minigames/puzzles with unique mechanics, and a surreal, sometimes nonsensical story. Plunker was made by one person while streaming live on Twitch.tv and also working a full 40+ hours a week for a good portion of the last three years. All of the art, all of the code, all of the ideas, all of the testing. At the end of it you've got 45~90 minutes of playtime. Examples of Included Features VR Parachuting VR People who are mad at you VR Interactive Farting Credits VR Grenade-Launcher style Water Balloon Turret Anxiety Inducing Life or Death Minigames (in VR) Playable VR Guitar Overly Realistic VR Bocce Ball More! Examples of Features Not Included Battle Royale Light Sabers Puppies Punching out your monitor by standing too close and throwing a VR bocce ball while trying to develop VR bocce ball live on Twitch (you're free to roleplay, but it's not reccomended from my own personal experiences) Due to the comedy and surprise/reaction based nature of Plunker, it's a fantastic game to play in front of an audience!",

Features - relaxing music - a stress relieving environment - family friendly content - full screen and windowed possibility - mute sound effects and/or music - day and night cycle - 6 flower body mutations Gameplay Plants is a single player game in which you first select a flower and then control the flower (upwards). Your friendly flower follows your mouse cursor at all times. That way you can guide it towards an item, while it leaves a trail of his own body behind. Flower movement uses energy, picking up water drops prevents running out of energy. When you are out of energy, the session ends. Update history This game was already available in other stores. The release here also brings a new update: v1.0.2. So while v1.0.1 was not available on Steam, here is a presentation of the changes from v1.0.1 to v1.0.2: Update v1.0.2 brings a lot of new things. (18 changes in total) The biggest additions are the following: * Achievements * 2 new Plant Body mutations: Dark Mode and Twinkling Stardust New content (5 additions) · Achievements · 2 new Plant body items (Dark Mode and Twinkling Stardust) · 3 new flowers to select · You now notice bees flying around · A tree has been added to the background Visible changes (9 changes) · The Colour game mode does not automatically make plant bodies disappear on the screen anymore, unless you touch it. Also: the speed gradually increases and gets a reset when you switch colours again · Main game: the floating dandelion now swings back and forth. · The font in the main menu and Restart screen is now bigger and more clear · Main menu: a purple oval is added to clearify which option is selected · The sound effect of going back in the menu screen is changed · A back-arrow has been added to all screens in the main menu · The background of the credits screen is cleaner (used to be an enlarged sprite). · The circle showing which flower you are about to select is increased in size · Pause-animation: the button is now disappearing more quickly. Fixes (4 fixes) · In the Colour game mode you could get under the grass. The camera now stops at the bottom when you move down · In the Colour game mode small spawned flowers would never fade away. They do not appear anymore due to the changes made in Colour Mode. · There was a situation where 2 items were spawned at the same time. Limited to max 1 · The crickets would keep on singing when restarting a game at night. Fixed.",

Contains 4 different arenas with and without multigoal zones. Optional laser guide and turbo function are ready to add to the fun. Single players can use third person view for even more crazy action. Race 10 challenging tracks offer a lot of racing fun. Use the turbo wisely to get around tricky corners and out-jump your opponents at the ramps. Try to beat your friends and set a new track record. Can be played in split-screen mode, top down and third person perspective. 1-2 human players and a maximum of 5 AI drivers. Battle Play with up to 6 friends or against the AI. Push your opponents out of a segmented arena that gets smaller constantly. Frantic mode adds a lot of tension by making the discs faster after a set amount of time. Five differently shaped arenas and a ton of options guarantee a load of variety. All game modes contain six optional and customizable powerups and there are a lot of options for you to tweak the game to your liking. We strongly recommend using controllers but for that true oldschool vibe you can use and share the keyboard as well. You will struggle, you will fail, you will laugh, you will need DISCS OF STEEL !",

        "detailed_description": "Welcome to Steel Crew! Steel Crew is a game that is all about Tank vs Tank combat where you can join the crew of a tank together with up to two of your friends. Team up and join in on the 4 on 4 Tank battle! Built for VR Steel Crew is built from the ground up with VR as its focus. It does still support other inputs than motion controllers. Gamepad and mouse and keyboard are supported in both VR and on traditional screens. Detailed interiors All tanks come with fully detailed interiors in an attempt to reproduce them as accurately as possible. Driver The driver obviously drives the tank. All tanks have a manual gearbox so there will be a lot of gear shifting. The driver has a very limited view and often depends on the commander to tell them what to do. When driving with the hatch open the driver will have a much better view and can help spot other tanks but will be vulnerable to incoming machine gun fire. The driver is also the one who can see the current 'health&quot; of the tank. Gunner The gunner has two guns at their disposal. The main gun and a coaxial machine gun. The gunner's view is very limited and without help from the commander and driver they will have a hard time finding a target. However the gunner has a periscope and a scope with magnification. To aim the gun (using motion controllers) there are three controls. One crank to aim up/down, another one for side to side and there is also a lever to use the powered traverse for faster but less precise aiming. Commander The commander has no direct input on the tank itself but has a great view of the surroundings. The commander has a few tools to help them. They are the only player in the tank with a map that shows the position as well as the position of other friendly tanks. It also shows the capture points on the map and their current status. To help the commander spot enemy tanks they are equipped with a monocular that can be used when riding with the hatch open. Just like the driver, the commander is vulnerable to machine gun fire with their head outside the tank. The commander can also call in airstrikes and talk to other commanders in the team to synchronize their attacks.",

A one-of-a-kind retro-styled comedy puzzler that pits your pitiful brain against brutal deathtraps in the pursuit of freedom. 4. An adventure with a deep hidden story you can only unlock through skill, patience and exploration. 5. The kind of thing you can send to your friends just to make them very, very angry. 6. The exact opposite of an open-world game. 7. Like Fortnite, but only in the sense that it’ll make you want to kill. With over three-and-a-half hours of recorded content, plus profanity, comedy, body horror, puzzles and warped logic, this is the Dark Souls of text adventures, the BDSM of RPGs, it’d be a walking simulator, but only if you were walking through a minefield. Level One has 60 minutes of specially mo-capped dialogue and performance, while levels 2, 3 and Darkest give you even more, and will bring you the true story of Darren. Your money goes into making the game bigger, louder and more dangerous! The Dark Room is the videogame adaptation of the interactive stage show of the same name from comedian John Robertson. So play this, then, when the show comes to your town, gather with the other survivors. Just remember - YA DIE! YA DIE! YA DIE! YA DIE!

        "detailed_description": "This story is to be implemented in time and it is based on a book called Elven Magic by Daniel Chay. 'A Game about Elves and Witches. Elven Voices delves deeper into Fae the elven witch's apprentice and there endless struggle to recover their lost spell book from Earthen Lands without drawing any attention to themselves because this is strictly forbidden by the Elven Elders. The story continues into another world and there are many twists and turns for Fae the Elven Girl and the Witch named Ellen that would have Fae be her apprentice to uncover. The imperial guard of the nearby capital city may prove difficult to avoid. It details the rise of a Wyvern Wraith and the plight of a Witch Wraith.&quot; This Game is an RPG Game and its game play is like WOW in that the game has levels of gear and it also has great graphical terrains of desert scenes and beach scenes. This game is still in development. The Objectives still need to be implemented. This has an advanced inventory and it saves progress this is the completed inventory. The 2nd partial inventory will be adapted over time as the code needs to be coded for each individual object and this takes time. Some are coded in this edition and some are not yet implemented. Inventory &amp; Quests keys: J,K,I. Horse Mount Keys: F. Camera: F1,F2,F3. Keys may differ from Mac to Windows Versions. Q. Dragon Fly/Take off. Use 'E' To interact with NPC's. The RPG Game(Elven Magic 2) is coded with Effects working on most builds and allows for the attack, these effects will have relied on without the use of weapons at this stage as melee combat will be introduced later without the use of guns specifically as a weapon. As the game's storyline will not involve guns for the attack of any humanoids, only creatures will be attacked using guns which will not be implemented like a weapon at all, only in the inventory, although it will take time to lock them. Elven Magic FPS is available for prepurchase and at this stage, you can attack and the Inventory works as well as a character sheet and crafting functioning is coming soon as recipes need to be added. You can also ride a horse on the beach in one scene. Things like purchasing of equipment will be added in time, if there is any please don't purchase anything in-game due to weather saving functionality works you can buy the game still as it is in beta not everything is working. The Mac Version of the game Elven Magic 2(MAC ONLY) is now like age of empires and has towers which can attack an army at the castle screen FUNC+F1,F2,F3 sorry guys this does not build on a windows system. What i intended to do is expand the towers and attack path across the whole world in time. To get into this game you will need the graphics settings to low at this stage. This Main Game (ElvenMagicPro) is not Required to load and play Elven Magic 2 and Elven Magic SE which are working well. You can often press Function + F1 or F2 or F3 to change the view for example if you press that in the ElvenMagicPro Game it will switch to another persons head from there you can see the holograms and light shining down., in Elven Magic SE you can now look over the sand dunes and see a train this is Simulation assets working as intended. Please Purchase as a bundle as this is the cheapest way at this stage. Prices may change without prior notice. This game can be implemented with over 100GB of content at this stage each build takes only between 2.5GB(MAC) and 7GB(WINDOWS &amp; MAC) each.",

        "reviews": "“Nicely paced book with a decent bit of bite to it. Love books with Elves as they are depicted in so very many different ways. Some with a little magic and others with a lot but they come in various shapes and sizes so to speak. Enjoyed reading the books although short, they were pretty interesting and in places riveting. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an enjoyable read but especially to all you Elf buffs out there.” 5 of 5 – Amazon",

Keep your score and vigilance meter maxed out by not taking any damage or being killed. Use the tactical mode top down view to detect and engage threats. Join your friends on an adventure through the world of Be Vigilant!, with three distinct acts for hours of team work focused game play. Player versus player and friendly fire options are also available. To get to distant locations, the team has to drive there. Ride with the team or drive your own motorcycle or cars. Carry excess items in your ride as you stop and search locations along the way. Along the path you take, you will be able to select from ten skill trees and over ninety skills to build your character your way. Some combat training skills are martial arts, melee weapons, archery, rifles and more. Some athletic training skills are running, jumping, weight training and more. Medical skill training includes self care, better use of medical equipment and more. Technology training skills are improved armor, explosives and more. Master one skill tree to become a specialist or overlap multiple skill trees to be prepared for anything. The RNG loot system means a legendary item is always one drop away. Virtually countless items, armors, and weapons are waiting to be found. Enemies use the RNG system to surprise the player with buffs and extra abilities.",

Here’s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus: Your Will The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a “personal representative”) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. With Quicken WillMaker Plus, you can revise and update your will whenever you like. Living Trust Ensure that your property bypasses lengthy and expensive probate proceedings. Your Health Care Directive Spare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions. Health Care Power of Attorney Name a trusted person (your “health care agent”) to make important medical decisions for you if necessary. Living Will State what types of medical treatment you do or do not want if you are too ill or injured to direct your own care. Your health care providers must do all they can to follow your wishes. Your Durable Power of Attorney for Finances A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your “agent” or “attorney-in-fact”) will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. Your Final Arrangements Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more. Documents for Your Executor Make sure your executor has needed forms and instructions to do the job: checklists, letters, notices and claim forms.

Fast paced, modern first person shooter action with seven unique main weapons. Built on the permissively licensed, open source Tesseract engine. Available for Windows and GNU/Linux. Parkour, impulse boosts, dashing, and other tricks. A huge amount of mutators and game altering variables. Create maps with other players in realtime co-op edit. Over 15 years of active development, and still going! Red Eclipse builds on its own legacy of fast-paced unique, impactful gameplay and combines that with the visual capabilities of the superb and modern Tesseract engine to create a game that redefines what a first person shooter is. There is absolutely no money whatsoever behind this project, and the entirety of the assets and source code are freely available to copy, modify, and redistribute. The entirety of the game is built on the contributions of volunteers, from the engine (which does not trace its heritage to any commercial studio) to the assets, levels, modes, user interfaces, and maps. We do not recieve lucrative income from selling skins or lootboxes or any microtransactions, and the servers and infrastructure is graciously run and maintained by volunteers. This game is built on the Tesseract engine, written by one of our developers, Lee Salzman. Tesseract is a modern, deferred pipeline engine with realtime dynamic lighting, shadows, HDR, screenspace reflection, and dynamic organic model deformation. Tesseract and its predecessors, Cube and Cube 2, are all built from the ground up as open source engines with more permissive licensing than essentially every other 3D engine available.

        "detailed_description": "Join our Discord! About the Game The realm of the living has been corrupted to its core and a storm is coming to change the world order. This storm is you, a mighty Necromancer, a sorcerer who denies death and leads the legions of the dead. Clerics and lords hope to hide behind high walls, but there’s no stronghold to cover them from your wrath. Smite hundreds of those standing in your way and turn them into your tools on the way to a greater purpose. The Unliving is a dynamic rogue-lite action RPG with strategic elements. Raise the undead, use numerous spells and explore a mystical world, all realised with darkly extravagant pixel-art. TURN ENEMIES INTO YOUR UNDEAD ARMY Each fallen foe can be resurrected and added to your army to create unlimited legions of the dead. These re-animated creatures have their own unique abilities, such as the undead Priest whose blessings in life, will now curse your enemies in death. UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF NECROMANCY Meet colorful characters - friends and foes alike. Question members of your own necromantic cult, force answers out of your enemies and even dialogue your own phylacterium - to gather the lost memories of the Necromancer piece by piece and reveal the nature of his immortality. Who knows, maybe you also find out the grim truth about the supreme hierarchies of the Church. CRUSH EVERYONE IN YOUR WAY Only some of the living are helpless victims, the rest can retaliate against your forces. They hold the line, move in large groups and wield powerful abilities too. They cherish their lives and will not fall easily, so unleash hell as the Undead Lord to bring them to their knees. CONQUER UNCHARTED LANDS The world is randomly generated for each run and is richly populated with an array of creatures, artefacts, secret rooms and deadly traps. Each part of the world is occupied by a variety of living inhabitants - invade villages and slay feeble peasants to reinforce your army or engage in a desperate fight to the death in the swamps against formidable foes. BATTLE EPIC BOSSES The powerful creatures of this shadowy world will do all they can to stop you. Each boss has a unique fighting style and set of abilities, meaning deftness in combat and strategic thinking will be crucial in emerging victorious from these gruelling encounters DIE AND RISE AGAIN Ability to deny death itself is the greatest secret of the Necromancer. Another mortal strike is merely a setback for him. Take a lesson from your death and don’t let your enemies catch you the same way twice.",

We love talking about cool stuff with our community! About the Game DeMagnete VR is a puzzle adventure inspired by magnetism, built from the ground up for virtual reality. Use your magnetic-powered gloves to solve puzzles and make your way to the top of a mysterious underground cavern. DeMagnete VR presents a variety of original magnetism mechanics that evolve with every chamber, as you find out more about what happened around you.     Unique Magnetism Mechanics In DeMagnete, each hand controls one magnetic pole, Positive and Negative. You use your hands to interact with objects in the environment, following basic rules of physics and magnetism: opposites attract but the same poles repel. There are a variety of magnetic objects, like boxes, barriers, propulsors, etc. Each puzzle is built by combining these objects and real physics rules to create new mechanics.     Progression-focused virtual reality gameplay Our goal with DeMagnete is to create an experience that not only immerses the player and makes use of the best that motion controls in VR have to offer, but also gives the player the sense of mechanical progression that gamers expect. DeMagnete VR is an experiment of magnetism and physics-based mechanics that evolve and deepen over 40+ puzzles.   Secrets Those who like to do some exploring may end up uncovering secrets that reveal more of the game's narrative.   Narrative and Player Companion The story of DeMagnete unfolds as you interact with the environment and your companion, Q. Voiced by the award-winning actress Ashly Burch, Q is the mysterious key master AI that controls the whole place and guides you through its chambers. Uncover the secrets hidden in the rock walls while Q leads you somewhere deep into the cavern.   A mysterious cave, a lost dweller and a lonely companion The story of DeMagnete centers around your character, D, and you have to find out what you're doing in this place. As you dig deeper into the mysteries of the cavern, you discover the truth about what happened there, and the role Q and yourself play in it all.",

        "detailed_description": "Join Discord On our Discord server there are always new information about the game. There you can exchange ideas and ask questions. If you're interested in previewing content, later testing phases, then the Discord Server is just right for you. About the Game Have you always dreamed of going on a gold hunt yourself? And to bring the valuable metal to light with small or large equipment and hard work? Then you now have the chance to show what you're made of and experience the different ways of finding and digging for gold with Gold Hunter. However, all beginnings are difficult. You start your adventure with some money and a metal detector. And when you have found your first gold, you expand your equipment with a small mobile unit. Over time, with more experience and with more gold, your mining operation grows and grows until, in time, you are mining the gold with the heaviest machinery and the biggest plant. And because the work in a mine never stops and there is always so much to do, you can now experience this adventure together with your friends. Manage your mining operation, hire and pay people to work for you, or assign free jobs that other players can take on and do for you. Current Game Features Gold prospecting with handheld, mobile and stationary equipment. Single and multiplayer mode Detailed 14 km² map 6 beginner claims and 5 claims for big machines Free placement of equipment and facilities Extensive simulation of all operations Day and night rhythm Different camera perspectives Controller and joystick support Integrated chat and voice Steam Cloud More game features to be added during Early Access Search for gold on land, in water and under the ice Detailed 81 km² map Different seasons Varied weather Over 60 claims Over 50 different vehicles on the ground, in the water and in the air Over 250 different items Facilities have to be assembled by the player himself Detailed resource system for fuel, water and electricity Waste water and overburden management Wear and tear and repairs of equipment and machines Extensive simulation of all work - everything has to be done by yourself. Extensive management of your mining operation Story and quests in single player mode Orders and employees in multiplayer mode Exchange with other players and companies in multiplayer mode Other activities outside of mining, for example fishing. Customisable machines, buildings and furniture Minimal survival integration (not mandatory) Achievements Further expansions planned following Early Access The adventure begins You have a gigantic 81km² map at your disposal for the search for gold, which is just waiting for you. You equip yourself with a metal detector and go - alone or with friends - in search of the first gold nuggets in the forest. The proceeds from this can be invested in a highbanker or a small mobile washing drum. The new equipment can then be put into operation on one of the beginner claims. The mining operation grows With perseverance and experience comes success - and with success the machines get bigger. And big machines need new space. Invest your money in a big claim and build up your plant there, using big excavators and other vehicles to keep the washing plant running. Hire friends in multiplayer to help you run your business to success. Your trademark Create your own company, configure your vehicles and your machines, build a house according to your wishes and furnish it so that the evenings can end comfortably with friends after hard work. New shores If you need a change of pace, how about digging for gold in the water with a dredger. Or how about digging for gold under the ice in winter. In Gold Hunter you will get to know and try out different ways of digging for gold. Stronger together Work together with friends on a claim to experience and celebrate success together. Or work with friends on a server in different companies and on different claims. Hire out equipment, place orders, or take orders yourself so that your expensive machines don't rust. There is a lot to do Gold Hunter puts a lot of emphasis on making the simulation of gold prospecting an experience. However, this also means that all activities and steps have to be carried out by yourself! Equipment has to be set up and adjusted. Levers and buttons have to be operated yourself, containers have to be filled manually, defective equipment has to be repaired and maintained.

        "about_the_game": "Have you always dreamed of going on a gold hunt yourself? And to bring the valuable metal to light with small or large equipment and hard work? Then you now have the chance to show what you're made of and experience the different ways of finding and digging for gold with Gold Hunter. However, all beginnings are difficult. You start your adventure with some money and a metal detector. And when you have found your first gold, you expand your equipment with a small mobile unit. Over time, with more experience and with more gold, your mining operation grows and grows until, in time, you are mining the gold with the heaviest machinery and the biggest plant. And because the work in a mine never stops and there is always so much to do, you can now experience this adventure together with your friends. Manage your mining operation, hire and pay people to work for you, or assign free jobs that other players can take on and do for you. Current Game Features Gold prospecting with handheld, mobile and stationary equipment.

Customisable machines, buildings and furniture Minimal survival integration (not mandatory) Achievements Further expansions planned following Early Access The adventure begins You have a gigantic 81km² map at your disposal for the search for gold, which is just waiting for you. You equip yourself with a metal detector and go - alone or with friends - in search of the first gold nuggets in the forest. The proceeds from this can be invested in a highbanker or a small mobile washing drum. The new equipment can then be put into operation on one of the beginner claims. The mining operation grows With perseverance and experience comes success - and with success the machines get bigger. And big machines need new space. Invest your money in a big claim and build up your plant there, using big excavators and other vehicles to keep the washing plant running. Hire friends in multiplayer to help you run your business to success. Your trademark Create your own company, configure your vehicles and your machines, build a house according to your wishes and furnish it so that the evenings can end comfortably with friends after hard work. New shores If you need a change of pace, how about digging for gold in the water with a dredger. Or how about digging for gold under the ice in winter. In Gold Hunter you will get to know and try out different ways of digging for gold. Stronger together Work together with friends on a claim to experience and celebrate success together. Or work with friends on a server in different companies and on different claims. Hire out equipment, place orders, or take orders yourself so that your expensive machines don't rust. There is a lot to do Gold Hunter puts a lot of emphasis on making the simulation of gold prospecting an experience. However, this also means that all activities and steps have to be carried out by yourself! Equipment has to be set up and adjusted. Levers and buttons have to be operated yourself, containers have to be filled manually, defective equipment has to be repaired and maintained. So when there is something to do, the player is challenged! Distraction And when you need a break, you can spend the time with various leisure activities, or explore the huge map and find places that are not in any travel guide.",

Each level is a room that has only one exit, and your goal is to overcome any obstacles (such as humanly unreachable platforms or remotely-controlled closed doors) to reach that exit and progress to the next level. To your help you have charge gun, cube and charge-proof walls (emitting light-blue segments). Charge gun is capable of positively or negatively charging cube and charge-proof walls. Depending on the charges applied, the interaction between them will be different: if cube and wall have opposite charges - cube will attract and eventually static cling to the wall; otherwise (alike charges) cube will repel away from the wall. The closer those are, the stronger the effect. There are major restrictions when it comes to charging objects: cube can either be positively OR negatively charged at the same time, or neutral; only one wall charge of the same sign can exist at the same time, and applying new alike wall charge to another location removes old. You will need to figure out how to take advantage of these tools and manipulate objects to progress through. Almost every level forces you to learn a new way of using these tools, and some of the mechanics that you already learned in previous levels are mixed in.",

        "detailed_description": "Codemancer brings the mystery of magic and the exhilaration of learning to code together in a fantasy universe that uses spell-casting as a way to teach and learn programming skills. Codemancer’s fantasy universe is filled with rival sorcerers and their minions for players to encounter along their journey. Codemancer is a non-violent, entertaining, and educational game designed to be inclusive and accessible to learners at any stage. Features include a gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and a programming interface that’s designed to be easy to understand by kids with varying degrees of skill and experience. Codemancer breaks down barriers that may have discouraged some kids from embracing technology and elevates their screentime to be more productive and entertaining. It isn’t a typical coding or technology game. WHAT IS CODEMANCER ALL ABOUT? Codemancer tells a moving story about Aurora, a young, creatively talented girl who’s trying to grow up, become independent, and do good in the world in the face of incredible obstacles when her father is suddenly kidnapped. Aurora has to embark on an adventure to save him as she grows into a gracious and independent young woman. She must learn magic spells to save her father, but the magic used in Aurora’s world works the same as programming does in ours. Inspire children to explore their potential as they discover the magic of coding. CODEMANCER IS AN EDUCATIONAL GAMING ADVENTURE: Codemancer is designed for 6 to 12 year olds as an educational game that teaches the magic behind coding—and can be fun for grownups, too! CODEMANCER SPECIFICALLY TEACHES: Sequential Algorithms Debugging Function Arguments Scope Looping Constructs Concurrent Programming ...AND TEACHES IN GENERAL: Computational Thinking Planning Problem Solving Resilience CODEMANCER FEATURES: A narrative inspired by popular works of young adult fantasy worlds such as Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Neverending Story, The Last Airbender, and many more! Gameplay that takes place in a hexagonal world, making it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye. 'Freeze time' ability, so players can debug the programs they've written and potentially code their way out of a jam to learn from their mistakes. Availability for PC, Mac, iPad, and Android tablets. CODEMANCER IS STRUCTURED FOR ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSIVITY: The goal of Codemancer is to be as broadly inclusive as possible by creating a gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and language interface that’s designed to make the game appeal to kids at different skill levels. Codemancer breaks down barriers that can hinder some kids from feeling comfortable with engaging with programming, for example Codemancer uses pips (like on a die) instead of numerals, and sets the gameplay in a hexagonal world that makes it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye. No syntax errors -- if you can enter a spell, it will run. Syntax errors can be frustrating and cause learners to quit before they really begin. Codemancer uses an open dyslexic font, where letters are designed to look distinctly different from each other to make reading easier for kids with dyslexia. The game is fully voiced, so reading is completely optional. Codemancer's programming language is designed to be accessible, but also translates easily to a variety of popular real-world programming languages (such as Python). Codemancer appeals to many educational groups, from children with special needs for reading, to younger children new to coding, to older children with more advanced coding and programming skill sets. Codemancer has the potential to reach under-represented groups in coding and teach them an often-exclusionary, but nonetheless important, 20th-century skill.",

Jim loved a jeep parking video game in his life but got stuck at its final level. Little Brother Jim alternates between the jeep parking game, and Paul's journey up to the hill. Note that the jeep parking levels can be challenging to some, but they are skippable after each few fails. On the other hand, if you want to focus more on the parking levels, and spend less on exploration bits, you can skip reading the notes and that will make it take a short while on the exploration levels. However it's suggested that you to take your time and inspect every detail of the game since it has been made with a lot of attention on each so you'll see things are connected while they seem not to be so. Highly immersive exploration levels with choices at their ends that make a difference at the end of the game Colorful and fun jeep parking levels that gradually increase in difficulty An emotional storyline that gradually reveals itself via a series of letters found in mailboxes Charming music that accompanies the emotional plot Atmospheric sound designed to carry the player through the highs and lows of their journey Dynamic weather effects such as rain, snow and fog Approachable gameplay at exploration levels, with light puzzle elements Some cute easter eggs to be found through careful world exploration Save progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each level.

All of the topics are ordered in a logical and structural way. At the end of each chapter, there is a test. If you pass this test successfully, the badge of that topic will light up on your profile. After a certain amount of chapters, there will also be an exam. The amount of content in each exam roughly corresponds with one year of chemistry at school (science option). Our goal is to explain everything as simple as possible, we don’t hide our content behind complex words. Chemistry is really interesting and essential and we truly hope to bring it to more people through this educational software. Learn more about the amazing world of atoms and molecules in the many chapters Quantism has to offer! What does Quantism offer? Chapters: phases, matter, chemical and physical changes, symbols, simple substances, reaction speed, reaction laws, safety, labs, writing chemical reactions, history, the atom, chemical bonds, oxidation states, chemical behavior. We hope to add much more content later. Easy and intuitive interface Clear animations and pictures A progress system to track your progress A test and exam system to test your newly acquired knowledge Are you a teacher, or do you represent a school? Our goal and passion is to make chemistry available to as many people as possible, so for schools, we offer a great discount. Please send an email for more information. When will Quantism get more chapters? When Quantism reaches enough interest, we will know that the software is widely used, and thus we will start to greatly expand the software.",

        "detailed_description": "Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke. Set in late 19th century Japan and England, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists, and “turnabouts” you’ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you! In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence. The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot! NOTE: This game can be played with English audio or with Japanese audio and English subtitles.",

        "detailed_description": "Join the community About the Game The Black Grimoire: Cursebreaker is a medieval fantasy adventure RPG inspired by the ‘oldschool’ atmosphere of adventure games of the past. Journey through a sprawling open world, converse with its many inhabitants and unravel the story of Rothar Aercrest – the cursed lord to the remote woodlands of Imberthale. Increase your power by advancing your skill levels and acquiring powerful items, unlocking special attacks and spells which will aid your way in defeating the worst monsters that lurk in the remote corners of the world. Choose your own playstyle and take your place as the most powerful adventurer to walk the lands! Variety of quests with deep writing. Numerous weapons and spells to employ in strategic combat. Permanent choices that affect gameplay. Large open world that rewards exploration. Skills &amp; Crafting systems that offer freedom of playstyle. Customizable player houses to rest your weary bones. Social multiplayer - meet other players in towns, taverns etc. Tired of ‘epic tales’ of ‘world ending proportions’, Cursebreaker offers stories of human pettiness, revenge and greed - all the good stuff. In this game you're not yet another 'chosen one' destined to save all life from impending doom and gloom. Instead, you're Lord Rothar Aercrest - the feudal ruler to the remote woodlands of Imberthale. Or at least you used to be... One fateful day your path crosses that of a dark wizard, Gabrius, who appears to be both tremendously powerful and frightfully malicious. Consequently you soon find yourself caught within a mortal feud between two powerful wielders of magic, all the while bound by a curse you desperately need to break free from. If Lord Rothar is to know peace again, Gabrius must surely die. That might not prove to be such a simple task. After all, what is death besides a mere nuisance to the master of the Black Grimoire? In Cursebreaker there’s no loading a save from a previous point in a playthrough, so the choices you are presented with tend to be permanent and can’t be taken back. Should you die in combat, you will simply continue at the nearest resurrection point, potentially having lost some of the valuables you may have been carrying. However, under normal settings dying should be relatively effortless to avoid - there are plenty of potions and other tools to guard against it. You may also find scavengers out in the world, who might be willing to sell any lost belongings back to you. Character progression in Cursebreaker is tied to the various skills you can advance. Every interaction in game tends to give experience in some skill area and gaining higher skill levels will unlock appropriate interactions and abilities. While fighting enemies in close combat, for example, you might expect your Offence and Defence skills to increase. As they do, you unlock new passive and activated abilities, can wield more sophisticated weapon and armor pieces and gain access to new traits from the appropriate trainers. The spellbook offers a large variety of both combat and non-combat utility. Finding and learning new spells may prove a challenge in itself, and casting more demanding spells will require preparation, such as gathering specific ingredients. Feel free to create your own playstyle by using any combination of ranged and melee weapons and spells! Chopping trees not only gives you crafting materials but also increases your skill in Woodsmanship, which may give you access to hidden areas in the wild and help you fight beasts. Similarly, you can advance Alchemy by finding and picking special herbs and crafting simple potions, but you will also be able to make bombs, poisons and more. Every skill should provide you with something unique and be worthwhile to practice. Advancing skills may also unlock hidden options when interacting with objects and NPCs in game.

        "about_the_game": "The Black Grimoire: Cursebreaker is a medieval fantasy adventure RPG inspired by the ‘oldschool’ atmosphere of adventure games of the past. Journey through a sprawling open world, converse with its many inhabitants and unravel the story of Rothar Aercrest – the cursed lord to the remote woodlands of Imberthale. Increase your power by advancing your skill levels and acquiring powerful items, unlocking special attacks and spells which will aid your way in defeating the worst monsters that lurk in the remote corners of the world. Choose your own playstyle and take your place as the most powerful adventurer to walk the lands! Variety of quests with deep writing. Numerous weapons and spells to employ in strategic combat. Permanent choices that affect gameplay. Large open world that rewards exploration. Skills &amp; Crafting systems that offer freedom of playstyle. Customizable player houses to rest your weary bones. Social multiplayer - meet other players in towns, taverns etc. Tired of ‘epic tales’ of ‘world ending proportions’, Cursebreaker offers stories of human pettiness, revenge and greed - all the good stuff. In this game you're not yet another 'chosen one' destined to save all life from impending doom and gloom. Instead, you're Lord Rothar Aercrest - the feudal ruler to the remote woodlands of Imberthale. Or at least you used to be... One fateful day your path crosses that of a dark wizard, Gabrius, who appears to be both tremendously powerful and frightfully malicious. Consequently you soon find yourself caught within a mortal feud between two powerful wielders of magic, all the while bound by a curse you desperately need to break free from. If Lord Rothar is to know peace again, Gabrius must surely die. That might not prove to be such a simple task. After all, what is death besides a mere nuisance to the master of the Black Grimoire? In Cursebreaker there’s no loading a save from a previous point in a playthrough, so the choices you are presented with tend to be permanent and can’t be taken back. Should you die in combat, you will simply continue at the nearest resurrection point, potentially having lost some of the valuables you may have been carrying. However, under normal settings dying should be relatively effortless to avoid - there are plenty of potions and other tools to guard against it. You may also find scavengers out in the world, who might be willing to sell any lost belongings back to you. Character progression in Cursebreaker is tied to the various skills you can advance. Every interaction in game tends to give experience in some skill area and gaining higher skill levels will unlock appropriate interactions and abilities. While fighting enemies in close combat, for example, you might expect your Offence and Defence skills to increase. As they do, you unlock new passive and activated abilities, can wield more sophisticated weapon and armor pieces and gain access to new traits from the appropriate trainers. The spellbook offers a large variety of both combat and non-combat utility. Finding and learning new spells may prove a challenge in itself, and casting more demanding spells will require preparation, such as gathering specific ingredients. Feel free to create your own playstyle by using any combination of ranged and melee weapons and spells! Chopping trees not only gives you crafting materials but also increases your skill in Woodsmanship, which may give you access to hidden areas in the wild and help you fight beasts. Similarly, you can advance Alchemy by finding and picking special herbs and crafting simple potions, but you will also be able to make bombs, poisons and more. Every skill should provide you with something unique and be worthwhile to practice. Advancing skills may also unlock hidden options when interacting with objects and NPCs in game. Available skills currently in game include Attack, Defence, Archery, Sorcery, Smithing, Crafting, Tailoring, Alchemy, Mining, Woodsmanship, Fishing and Cooking.

From the creators of / Jin is your son and the locals panicked when they heard that he went missing along with 2 elementary school girls. While the police were holding a heavy search around town, you receive 3 photos of the missing kids with some writing behind, 'Come alone or I'll freeze them to death.&quot; Out of desperation, you decide to embark on a daunting rescue mission to an abandoned inn up the piercing cold mountains. Yuki Onna | 雪女 is a similar game to Aka Manto, not a psychological horror/walksim. The game is around 90 ~ 120 minutes long depending on your skill and playstyle. Warning: This game is very challenging. You are only granted one life and death would mean a start over. If you are not confident with the ability to stay calm and persevere in the scariest of situations, you may find this game frustrating. Features: PSX/PS1 aesthetic: A nostalgic horror experience with visuals inspired by 5th generation games. Survival horror - The enemies will constantly try and hunt you while you explore. You may resort to hiding, but who knows how well that goes. Explore - Navigate through claustrophobic hallways. You may encounter interesting characters along the way. Atmosphere - Old and abandoned Japanese house setting. Puzzles - Bizarre and intricate puzzles. Perma Death - One life, no saves. Every death counts to do better on the next round. Replay value - Good ending? Bad ending? See which one you'll get. Artwork by akiko★ @ pixiv",

        "reviews": "“This was an enjoyable experience for me. It's not a perfect experience of course, with too many items being handed to you while not knowing what still needed to be used and what you were done with. Overall though I enjoyed the experience and don't regret the purchase.” Recommended – GoodKhaos “Scariest game of 2019 no joke! Chilla's Art did it again, they develop a game that is terrifying as no other. This game is similar to Aka Manto but scariest because there is no way to hide from Yuki Onna, she is very unpredictable, and her transformation is going to make you scream for sure. I recommend this game 100% and more if you love horror, and Japanese legendary ghosts.” Recommended – IGXL Insane Gaming XL",

        "detailed_description": "City Breaker is a VR physics-destruction game focused around destroying large-scale physics structures like skyscrapers. Currently, the game is centered around throwing blocks at buildings to knock them down. Your throws are scaled up in power depending on the block, so you're able to throw 90 pound blocks at about 400 miles per hour and watch as they rip through the side of a building and cause the entire thing to collapse. Every level is hand crafted, and as you progress, you'll begin seeing realistic physics-based rockets, skyships, turrets, and even ragdoll human-like creatures The game is in Early Access. Currently, there are several awesome features (AI-controlled skyships, for example) that aren't available because they cause a lot of lag. For example, when I built a Nuclear Reactor level and set it off, the resulting lag from the 10,000 physics collisions happening at once dropped the frame rate to around 30. That should never happen in VR, so that level and other potentially broken items are also not in the game. (The game runs great, by the way: If you have a 1080 you should never have a framerate below 144. I wanted this game to run as smoothly as Beat Saber and to a large extent, it does). The game is going to get better over time. Advanced turrets, ragdolls, and AI-controlled skyships are all in the works: I just need to optimize them. There will also be two more game modes included with the next update, Rampage (infinite procedural levels) and Archery (where you shoot down buildings with explosive arrows).",

        "detailed_description": "Together in Battle is a fantasy gladiator SRPG with vibrant characters, funny random events, team management mechanics, and emergent relationship-building. Uncover a sinister conspiracy; fight deep turn-based tactical battles; watch your characters grow together. You’ve arrived in the island kingdom of Dese with a secret mission to enter the gladiatorial games and find loyal fighters. Hunted by an imperial praetor, you must maintain a low profile even as you find yourself drawn into intrigues that will decide the fate of Dese itself. Recruit and manage a team of fighters. Stay stocked on food, make payroll, and keep your team practicing. But beware: they have feelings! Let their friends fall in battle, and they may become depressed. Let morale fall too low, and you’ll risk resentment and desertion. Keep them happy, however, and they will grow close to one another, form fond memories, give nicknames–even share their combat skills! With skill and patience, you will emerge victorious…together in battle. Each day, you'll have 2 Time Points to spend: you can fight in the arena, send characters away on quests, shop, recruit new allies, and more. At night, you'll return to camp and watch your character's personalities come alive as they talk, pursue their interests, and build relationships with one another! You're the boss--you get to decide how each day is spent. But your choices matter. To succeed, you'll want to make every day count. Every character you recruit has distinct traits, personal histories, beliefs, hobbies, and secrets. These differences matter: a jokester may do funny impressions to boost morale; a hunter may boost your stocks with wild game; a baker may use food to produce cookies and cakes you can eat or sell; a gambler may visit bars around town and win money for you. Dancers are nimble; sailors are good swimmers. Some characters are prone to depression; some, to self-doubt. Some self-soothe with long walks or prayer; others undertake long-term projects like growing vegetables, forging weapons, or writing novels. Learn what makes each character tick as they grow and form powerful bonds of friendship! Fight battles that reward creativity and good positioning, not just lucky die rolls. With a deterministic core that never wastes your time, Together in Battle's turn-based tactical combat nonetheless features incredible depth: Elevation : claim the high ground to boost your effectiveness and hinder the enemy's! Knockbacks galore : shove and throw enemies into water, lava, and chasms; off of cliffs; or into each other! Backstabbing : strike from behind to avoid counterattacks and score a huge damage bonus! Destructible environments : bust down doors, blow up walls, hack through bushes, chop through barricades! If you can see it, you can smash it. Defensive terrain : take up position in tall grass to gain a defense boost--or hack it down to deny that same advantage to the enemy. Create new structures on the battlefield: build your own bridges and barricades; freeze water to form ice bridges; place explosives to detonate at an opportune moment; set traps for enemies to wander into (or just shove them in yourself). Extreme turn flexibility : move a character, move a second character, then return to finish the first character's turn. An unlimited undo stack lets you redo it all if you don't like where everyone ended up! Clever AI : face enemies that use the terrain to their advantage, take advantage of weak positioning, cut through barriers, and compete with you for item pickups. You won't see everything Together in Battle has to offer in a single playthrough--or two. Every game offers a new experience. TiB includes: 24 base classes with branching promotions for a total of 72 distinct character classes ; More than 175 skills ; 6 playable species ; Dozens and dozens of random events and side quests that can play out in multiple different ways; A near-limitless variety of unique, procedurally generated characters ; Hundreds of thousands of possible procedurally generated weapons and pieces of armor , including unique and personal weapons; A trainer you can use to shore up your characters' stats or even multi-class them; A jobs board with randomized jobs you can hire characters out for to earn money; A brilliant blend of procedurally generated arena battles and hand-designed side quest and plot battles ! Together in Battle also comes with a campaign creation suite to let you build your own full-fledged SRPG campaigns ! Build characters in the character creator ! Sculpt battlefields and place armies in the map editor ! Compose cut scenes in the cut scene editor ! Write branching dialogue trees for both battles and cut scenes using the dialogue editor ! Create new skills for your characters to use in the skill editor ! Craft new items and equipment for players to use in the item editor ! Need ideas? Let the game roll up full-fledged characters and battles for you to edit (or simply use as-is)! Construct your own scripts, then assign them to items and skills for whatever custom effects you can dream up! Mod support for custom music, sound effects, character classes, AI profiles, and more! Together in Battle is set in the Telepath universe, and serves as a follow-up to 2022's critically acclaimed Telepath Tactics Liberated .",

It adds a layer of depth to the genre that is absolutely mind-blowing.” Adam the Fanatic “[W]hile we already know the tactical layer is solid titanium, it’s the building on character growth and interplay that produces wildly differing experiences from player to player, play through to play through.” PressPlayGaming",

        "detailed_description": "Check out HumanitZ! / About the Game Please wishlist the game to stay up to date! Mainly created by a team of 5 people , Broken Pieces is the first game to come out of the French game development studio Elseware Experience . When Elise and her fiancé decided to leave urban life and settle near the French coast, she could not imagine that she would end up completely alone. Now, surrounded by strange phenomena in a dark, post-Cold War climate, Elise will have to investigate and unravel the mysteries surrounding the region of Saint-Exil, its ritualistic cult, and its lighthouse overlooking the coast. Broken Pieces is an action-packed investigative and adventure video game set in France. The game puts you in the shoes of Elise, a woman in her thirties who finds herself in the village of Saint-Exil in an imaginary region reminiscent of Brittany. Following an unexplained paranormal phenomenon, Elise is stuck, completely alone and out of time. Your investigation begins here… Playtime : 9 to 12h. DLSS supported. Explore the area of Saint-Exil and its surroundings in the 1990s. Choose between either a standard TPS camera as well-known in modern TPS or a completely revised version of the camera system that accompanied legendary game franchises of the 90s, aimed at providing greater flexibility and player agency. Switch between 2 camera angles in any situation or drop into a first-person view to have a closer look around. Interact with the environment to learn more about what has happened to you in Saint-Exil. Your investigation will be rhythmically punctuated by cinematic sequences, with motion entirely captured from handheld cameras. Enjoy a thriller atmosphere in your adventure to the fullest extent. Keep an eye on the time with your watch; it is imperative that you get home before nightfall. Manage your inventory capacity and ensure that you carry about what you need to make progress. A variety of additional interactive elements, such as a vintage arcade machine, is available in your main and secondary quests. Change the weather of Saint-Exil to forge new paths or solve the puzzles blocking your way. You will discover tapes from which you can draw clues to help you in your investigation. Use the tape player to fast-forward or rewind the tapes and home in on the information you seek. Listen to your tapes while exploring the village of Saint-Exil and enjoy a seamless experience of discovery. Discover the music composed by Pierre for Élise that will accompany you in your adventure. Face challenging enemies with a unique combat system using fixed camera angles. Dodge your enemies or hold them at a distance using your powers to better defeat them. Restore your health by grabbing a drink in the fridge, catching a nap on a bench or spending a night in the safety of your bed. Craft high-quality ammo and upgrade your gun to increase your fighting abilities.",

        "detailed_description": "Easy Red 2 is the game for those who know just what they want from a World War 2 shooter: simulation in weapons and mechanics, historical accuracy in battles, and expansive maps leaving room for large-scale infantry and vehicle combat alike. In this new version of Easy Red, we wrote everything from scratch to reach a quality of game mechanics and optimization to manage and graphical design that looks appealing yet also runs well on lower-end machines. Fronts of War In Easy Red 2, you will be taken to both the European and Pacific fronts of the war. On the European front, you will be taken to the shores of Anzio, Italy - working your way towards the bombed peaks of Monte Cassino . You will also be taken to Kos - the Greek island invaded by the Germans in 1943. In the Pacific, you will go to Kwajalein - the Japanese-occupied island invaded by the United States Marine Corps in 1944. As you can view in the changelogs here , during most of 2021, 2022 and 2023, Easy Red 2 received at least an update a week, usually more. We want to keep this practice up and deliver new features very often such as new weapons, uniforms, vehicles, factions, game modes, and more. Usually, the new features we introduce come from suggestions that users can give on the Discord server here . For information about future content that will be added, check out the Easy Red 2 roadmap here: / Simulation and Immersivity That’s what we want for Easy Red 2. We want the player to feel a hint of the real emotions, thoughts, and sense of adrenaline rush of the battlefield. Around the player will be a fury of explosions, gunfire, devastation, orders, and yells from those around them. The player will be rewarded not for his kills obtained, but for his strategic prowess and survival skills on the field. Large battles and historical locations All campaigns take place in large open-world maps that are reproductions of the real locations of historical battles, with the plans and layout of the battles faithful to events that have historically occurred. Squad-based Gameplay No one fights alone. A good, hard-earned victory requires a good hardened team- so jump in as the squad leader , the medic , or maybe the radioman . You’ll always have a job to do within your squad. In our levels, we particularly focused on creating dynamically occurring sub-objectives that differ from the main mission objectives. For example, while the main objective of the greater team may be to conquer a specific area, a sub-objective could be requesting a tank to clear its way from an anti-tank gun that has been sighted, or getting your squad to take out that anti-tank gun yourself. This allows the gameplay to play out slightly differently each time depending on how everything plays out. Vehicles War machines changed warfare forever, and the second world war proved that unequivocally. Prepare to jump into a Panzer 4, M4 Sherman, M3 Lee , or any other of the more than 100 vehicles present in the game. We decided to let the player have full control of the crew within their vehicles; they will be able to drive and shoot tanks, as long as there are crewmen to operate each armament. Also, battles don’t stop when a tank is disabled- lots of tank crews in World War 2 had time to escape from the scuttled tanks and survive the battles, and so do they in Easy Red 2. If you lose your tank in a fight, you’ll need to bring your crew (or what’s left of your crew) back to your lines safely on foot. Multiplayer Play online in both PvP and PvE missions from either the base game, your own missions from the Mission Editor, or from the workshop! Play with your own squad or join a squad of your friends Create a match whenever you want and on any map you want! Modding Modding has also been added to Easy Red 2, and players can now create content to use in their own custom missions, such as custom weapons, vehicles, props, buildings (also with destructibility), factions, voice acting, terrain textures and details, inventory items and more! Map &amp; Mission Editor The Map Editor makes it possible to create custom maps using brush tools to raise/lower the terrain, paint the textures, or add grass and props from the base game. The Mission Editor allows anyone to create their own missions for the game using maps from the base game or maps made with the Map Editor. Both maps and missions can be shared &amp; downloaded from the Steam Workshop Devastation of war Explosions will destroy sandbags, walls, fences, vehicles, defenses, and entire buildings throughout the battlefield. This can radically change the power positions and tides during a fight. Enemy fire suppresses you and your squad, lowering your accuracy and decreasing your overall peripheral vision. You will have to learn how to move safely within a combat scenario and keep your helmet on your head without it getting shot or blown off. Optimization Everyone wants a smooth playing game, so we designed our graphical style to bring about pleasing animations, textures, and effects while leaving room for a high and stable frame rate, even despite the extreme amount of units and vehicles that will be on screen, contributing to your immersion in the fight.",

For example, while the main objective of the greater team may be to conquer a specific area, a sub-objective could be requesting a tank to clear its way from an anti-tank gun that has been sighted, or getting your squad to take out that anti-tank gun yourself. This allows the gameplay to play out slightly differently each time depending on how everything plays out. Vehicles War machines changed warfare forever, and the second world war proved that unequivocally. Prepare to jump into a Panzer 4, M4 Sherman, M3 Lee , or any other of the more than 100 vehicles present in the game. We decided to let the player have full control of the crew within their vehicles; they will be able to drive and shoot tanks, as long as there are crewmen to operate each armament. Also, battles don’t stop when a tank is disabled- lots of tank crews in World War 2 had time to escape from the scuttled tanks and survive the battles, and so do they in Easy Red 2. If you lose your tank in a fight, you’ll need to bring your crew (or what’s left of your crew) back to your lines safely on foot. Multiplayer Play online in both PvP and PvE missions from either the base game, your own missions from the Mission Editor, or from the workshop! Play with your own squad or join a squad of your friends Create a match whenever you want and on any map you want! Modding Modding has also been added to Easy Red 2, and players can now create content to use in their own custom missions, such as custom weapons, vehicles, props, buildings (also with destructibility), factions, voice acting, terrain textures and details, inventory items and more! Map &amp; Mission Editor The Map Editor makes it possible to create custom maps using brush tools to raise/lower the terrain, paint the textures, or add grass and props from the base game. The Mission Editor allows anyone to create their own missions for the game using maps from the base game or maps made with the Map Editor. Both maps and missions can be shared &amp; downloaded from the Steam Workshop Devastation of war Explosions will destroy sandbags, walls, fences, vehicles, defenses, and entire buildings throughout the battlefield. This can radically change the power positions and tides during a fight. Enemy fire suppresses you and your squad, lowering your accuracy and decreasing your overall peripheral vision. You will have to learn how to move safely within a combat scenario and keep your helmet on your head without it getting shot or blown off. Optimization Everyone wants a smooth playing game, so we designed our graphical style to bring about pleasing animations, textures, and effects while leaving room for a high and stable frame rate, even despite the extreme amount of units and vehicles that will be on screen, contributing to your immersion in the fight.",

        "reviews": "“There’s an open ended element to Grow that makes it something special. Far beyond the inviting graphics and the urgent environmental tale it tells, this is a thoughtful and deliberate balance of cute and considered gameplay concepts that make it a serious time sink.” Spieletipps “Overall, a fantastic game that yields a relaxing experience and a gaming experience for all. The adventure is fun and awe-inducing. The graphics and music are coupled well together and marry each other to make for an amazing fantasy feel” Giga Games “One of the best features of Grow: Song of The Evertree is the art design. The environments of every location are saturated with color and clean detail. Blades of grass blow in the breeze, the water ripples as fish swim through, and flowers stand out with vibrant hues. These details mixed with the relaxing soundtrack make it easy to lose track of time while playing and allow easy immersion into the world” Gamepro",

Customize Your Heroes Customize your heroes' abilities with a wide variety of equippable relics, that can do anything from modifying attributes to granting new skills.

Build up a town over time with multiple buildings and varied upgrades to support your favorite strategies. Features 100 Playable Character Classes (by end of EA) - Heroes from all throughout history and even the future. Find and unlock them all! 6 Unique Stages (by end of EA) - Each stage contains unique enemies, items, encounters, and heroes to unlock.

In turn, this has led to widespread Persecution of anyone with magic abilities, something people are born with and have no control over. With the powerful always clamoring for more power, it could only take a single elected emperor to begin the genocide of all magic people… CHARACTERS Play as Vyral, a far-from-perfect mercenary who initially shuns his dormant magic abilities. With a hostile brother and mysterious family past, discovering who he is and where he stands is part of the early adventure.

Rounding out the playable characters includes outsider Poppy, a hostile foreigner with little trust, and several guest party members as situations evolve. Bismarck, Vyral’s brother, who leads a mysterious faction of soldiers in black. His organization targets areas of powerful magic, but their exact motives and goals are unclear.

        "detailed_description": "Welcome to Whiskey Island! You have reached the shores of Whiskey island - a distant echo in the mist of time and memory. Will you stay to build a more colourful life, of leave it behind in search of greener pastures? Game Play Whiskey Island is a 3D immersive environment with a first-person point of view. Explore the island on foot, drive trucks, or operate locomotives to assemble trains and switch tracks. The basic idea is to use trains and trucks to transport cargo. Pick up resource cargos from various locations around the island and deliver them to factories and mills for processing. The finished goods can then be transported to other factories or to the Seaport for final delivery. Transporting cargo will keep the wheels of industry turning, and Whiskey Island can be a busy place when the lumber mill, fruit factory, smelter, metal works, and distillery are operating at full capacity. Factories and mills require resources including logs, ore, grain, fruit, boxes, barrels, and general supplies, to produce products, and the finished goods must be removed from the loading docks in a timely manner or production stops. Be careful to maintain your equipment - the trucks and trains need fuel and maintenance to operate efficiently. Thankfully the Island Garage and the Railway Workshops are there to help. Whiskey Island can also be a relaxing and casual escape if you'd rather just drive trucks and trains, explore beaches, and hike in the mountains without worrying about cargo. Building production may stop for a while - it can always be restarted by transporting cargo when you're ready. Gold is earned for each cargo unit delivered, and Whiskey Island becomes a more colourful place as your Happiness level increases. But beware! If you leave on the next tramp steamer, you will leave the Island behind as a distant and fading memory. With Trucks, Trains, and Transport, places to go and things to do, Whiskey Island is waiting for you!",

        "detailed_description": "■ About Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! ■ Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! ■ Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland! ■ Characters 〇 Usamura-san A strange, white rabbit that seems to be really busy for some reason. It looks like there's a zipper on his back...? He's also looking for Alice. 〇 Cheshire Cat A cryptic feline who appears before Usada and Kotora and enjoys testing her skills against them. Perhaps she has another goal aside from just getting in their way...? 〇 Mad Hatter A dignified lady who holds a tea party practically every day. Beloved by the denizens of Wonderland. It looks like she lost something important recently. 〇 Alice The person that Usada, Kotora, and Usamura-san are searching for. Just where in the world did she go? The Mad Hatter and the others might know something about that. ■ Story One summer's day, Usada and Kotora go to the library to do their homework. While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. 'I found this interesting-looking book!&quot; Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: &quot;Find Alice.&quot; As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... ■ Features Character illustrations by the talented PicPicGram ( Ninja Girl , Japanese School Life ) Developed by illuCalab ( A Magical High School Girl ) Two playable characters Two difficulties to choose from",

        "detailed_description": "RUN TANK RUN Run Tank Run is a parkour game where you drive a tank and rush forward along a straight road to reach the goal within a time limit. INFO On the road, you'll encounter other vehicles blocking your way. Use your superior driving skills to avoid them, or turn your tank's cannon and blast them away. Each time you fire and hit a vehicle, you can gain extra time, and if you achieve consecutive hits, you can accumulate combo points and earn bonus time based on your maximum combo. However, you need to reload your ammo after each shot, during which time you'll be unable to fire again. If you get stuck in traffic, you'll be helpless, and the smoke from the destroyed vehicles will block your vision, making it hard to see ahead. You need to make quick decisions about whether to continue firing to extend your time or to use your ammo to clear obstacles. Remember that you're driving a tank, a powerful vehicle that can also ram other vehicles aside. However, this action can cause damage to your tank, slow you down, and interrupt your combo. Use it wisely. STAGES The road is not always the same, and you need to adapt to different conditions: ● The wide and bright forest road is always friendly at the beginning. ● The dark temple ruins trail will obscure your view of the road ahead. ● The crowded city roads have narrow two-lane roads with fixed obstacles, but there are also clever spaces outside the lanes that you can use. ● Space offers a magical environment with unexpected hazards. POWERFULL TANKS The game offers 14 different World War II tanks, each with its own unique characteristics such as high acceleration, top speed, thick armor, or short reload time. Try to earn rewards and unlock all of them by completing each level. CHALLENGE MODE Challenge mode is available for each environment you pass. In this mode, you will run at same road, and there are random vehicles that can add more time or repair your tank on the road. Use these advantages to see how far you can go before the countdown ends. MORE The game supports playing at multiple resolutions, and playing on ultrawide or vertical screens adds more fun.",
        "about_the_game": "RUN TANK RUN Run Tank Run is a parkour game where you drive a tank and rush forward along a straight road to reach the goal within a time limit. INFO On the road, you'll encounter other vehicles blocking your way. Use your superior driving skills to avoid them, or turn your tank's cannon and blast them away. Each time you fire and hit a vehicle, you can gain extra time, and if you achieve consecutive hits, you can accumulate combo points and earn bonus time based on your maximum combo. However, you need to reload your ammo after each shot, during which time you'll be unable to fire again. If you get stuck in traffic, you'll be helpless, and the smoke from the destroyed vehicles will block your vision, making it hard to see ahead. You need to make quick decisions about whether to continue firing to extend your time or to use your ammo to clear obstacles.

It falls upon your halo to plan out the defenses, however your adversaries shall not stand idly as they will blot out the sun with fire just to clip your wings. Yet, you are not defenseless as the angel can smite enemies on his own if need be. Unlike other Tower Defense games, Otherwar's cast of enemies will keep you on your toes as almost every enemy fires a different kind of projectile. From the ever-following eyeballs to slowly approaching wide spider webs and patterns of swirling leaves cast by undead treants. Amidst the chaos of battle, you will also have to be on the look-out for certain enemies such as necromancers, who, if allowed to linger for too long, will raise skeletons from the dead that may overwhelm your defenses. Before each mission you will have a chance to select towers and skills that will aid you in battle. From straight-forward offensive towers to more situational constructs such as slowing fields that will bog down approaching enemies or emplacements that shoot down incoming projectiles. Besides structures, the angel can also upgrade his own skills during the battle and acquire new abilities between missions. Making each of the 9 levels a puzzle for you to solve. Go, Defender!

With a dark storyline, and an intensifying horror experience, the further you descend, Depth 6 is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. The Story The government has decided to cement the entrance of the Purple Lavender mine after reporting over 117 deaths in the mine and an additional 24 missing. This does not make sense, why did so many people have to perish before action was taken to close down the mine, and how could so many sneak in when the mine is under constant surveillance? The Purple Lavender mine is scheduled to be cemented in tomorrow morning. This gives me enough time to quickly get in, document the area, and get out. Something is being hidden, and I intend to find out what. Here is what I know so far about the Purple Lavender Mine: 1) It is reported to have 6 depths, however, I do not believe this has been confirmed. 2) There is a rumor, the deeper you descend, the more messed up things you will experience. Supposedly the pressure starts to mess with your head. 3) The original miners 70 or so years ago are a mystery. Nobody knows who they were or who their families were. All that is left to do is to set out and hope for the best… Inside Depth 6 is a short horror game with an estimated single completion time of ~60 min. As such, Inside Depth 6 does NOT offer save-game functionality. Inside Depth 6 must be completed in a SINGLE SITTING . Inside Depth 6 includes 3 endings coupled with all sorts of achievements , puzzles , and mysteries to solve. And as always, you cannot go wrong with a little Easter egg ! Developer's Note: And so, yet another game has been completed. This one came a little later than expected, but better late then never. Inside Depth 6 is the first game I've built that does not take place in a single setting. In other words, unlike Suite 776, A Girl's Fabric Face, Mind's Eyes, or any other game I've built before that typically take place in a home, Inside Depth 6 takes place in a very large mine with changing scenery every corner you turn! Of course, that is one of the reasons this game took so long to build, because it was quite literally much larger and more complicated to build than any of my previous games. Nonetheless, I believe the game turned out quite well, and I believe it does its job quite well. I genuinely hope you all enjoy the experience that Inside Depth 6 has to offer. I am very happy to say that I am continuing to learn new tricks in game development, and I hope to continue learning even more! It is definitely not easy being a 1-man developer who is self-taught; without a doubt, I do reach many limitations throughout the development journey; however, I believe I am still able to overcome many of my limitations to provide you all with an experience to remember! With that being said, I want to give everybody who has provided me with support a very big thank you! I will continue to learn, grow, and provide better content for you all year-round :)",

        "detailed_description": "Recalling the straightforward and addictive challenge of 8-bit classics, Squad Killer puts you in control of a retro arcade experience with a little modern flair. Graphics are presented in pixelated two-tone style but offer a touch of detail, customization and precision that pushes beyond the limits of its inspirations. Adjust the color palette, choose between multiple play modes, purchase upgrades and overcome unpredictably shuffled stage order with each run! The objective is simple – clear all enemies from the rooms you enter, obtain a key and proceed to the next level. But victory is far from certain as new types of enemies aim to end your run and a boss encounter awaits every five stages. Kill or be killed! Take each one down quickly and strategically to collect coins and buy power-ups to stack the deck in your favor. GAME FEATURES: - Jump, shoot and collect coins as you turn each room into a pixelated massacre! - Throw grenades to clear enemies faster! - Flip tables to hide from enemy fire! - Knee slide through bullets and enemies to avoid damage! - Play through 20 levels with each run, shuffled to keep you on your toes. - Unlock Boss Rush to challenge all the big baddies with no help from power-ups. - Try your hand at Stacked Deck mode to start with 7 random upgrades. - Adjust the distinctive two-tone color palette to suit your style!",

The game borrows mechanics from Dwarf Fortress , Divinity: Original Sin 2 , Stardew Valley and the Witcher Series . You wash ashore on The Isle of Elanor, the last bastion of humanity remaining in the world. You retain only fragments of your memory – your origins are a mystery. The people of the isle are puzzled by your inexplicable arrival. The situation on the island is grim: many people are poor, destitute, and in some cases close to starving. There's social strife and division. You're given a small plot of land. Can you help humanity survive? At the highest difficulty level, the game is meant to be challenging. If you're not careful, you will starve. Select skills and attributes to determine your build: a tank , melee fighter , or a ranged attacker ? Or choose a build that doesn't specialize in combat. The Isle of Elanor is a game about player choice . What type of home to build? Who to befriend or who to make an enemy of? Set in an imaginary period of the Earth's past, it's a world that borrows elements from both Midgard and Middle Earth. The peoples of Middle Earth (humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, etc) appear in the game. Complex combat mechanics featuring single-handed (quick) and two-handed (long-range) basic attacks, skills (magic), and the use of a shield. This is more than a farming, fishing, and mining game. In fact, your home isn't necessarily a farm. You can manufacture pottery, furniture or craft weapons and armor. Become a part of the community. Give food and items to needy townspeople. Watch the townspeople prosper, or decline, along with the home you build. You will face the consequences of your actions. Deep branching dialog options. Learn about the people and the history of the island. Features a realistic geology model. Stone occurs in sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic layers. Some types of stone, ore, and jewels are available to mine only in certain layers. Just a few of the types of stone: Bauxite, Cobalite, Granite, Gypsum, and Olivine. When you craft an item out of stone, the item retains the properties (color, weight, value) from the stone. The same mechanic applies to items crafted from wood. Factional alliances. The non-player characters on the island are grouped into factions. Most NPCs have families. Your relationship with one family member affects your relationship with the other family members. There are multiple towns in the game which also form factions. The guiding principle behind the quest system is consequences . Quests result in small changes here and there to show how the world is changed – for better or worse.",

I wish I had full 360 radial movement, a boost, a double jump, and slow-motion capabilities...”? If so, then I AM DIE is the game for you! Set across a series of surreal floating islands with procedurally-generated musical soundscapes, I AM DIE is a physics-based 3D puzzle platformer in which you must find, release, and guide a ball to its goal, weaving your way through an increasingly fiendish set of ramps, tubes, conveyors, and other obstacles. But each roll of the dice counts toward your final score, so as you explore and progress, you must battle against the forces of randomness to keep your level-complete time FAST and your roll-score LOW! With over fifty main levels (and a few secret ones), I AM DIE is a game that’s easy to play and difficult to master, and may have you tearing your hair out every time you delicately guide yourself toward a “one” and inexplicably land on a “six”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀    ♥♥ Tightly programmed and expansive controls ♥♥ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✿✿ Over 50 unique levels ✿✿ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀     ♫♩ Procedurally generated music ♩ ♫ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀    ☘☘ Secrets and achievements ☘☘ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀    ↶↶ Behind the scenes content ↷↷ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀     ⊘⊘ Should run on very low-end machines (because it was made on one) ⊘⊘ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀   ♥♥ The dice has a super cute voice! ♥♥ No microtransactions.

Thalos knows he's found his beloved, but Dusty must never let himself grow close to a vampire. A kinetic visual novel that grows spicier with each installment! Dusty is the next in line to lead the vampire hunting organization Jagerin, that's why he enrolled in the university owned by the world's most notorious vampire, Thalos. He hoped to learn more about his mortal enemy. Instead he ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time and is mistaken for the man Thalos chose as his next familiar. He's put in a trance and the irrevocable blood ritual is performed. Now Dusty is under Thalos' dark powers, and his mother has been murdered by the insidious vampire Johann. It's Dusty's turn to lead the global vampire-hunting organization, and his job to destroy Johann. He's not ready for either, and he's certainly not willing to be a vampire's familiar. Dusty has no choice but to join forces with the vampire he's irrevocably linked to. He needs his help against a new kind of evil vampire. He just has to make sure he doesn't wind up in bed with his new master in the process. Thalos, the immortal of immortals, has existed for eons, but he's never had a familiar who could share his dreams before. Dusty has a secret he's not letting Thalos unravel. Was their ill-fated meeting truly by chance? Based on the bestselling Vampire Slave novel by Yamila Abraham and illustrated by Italian studio Dany&amp;Dany. Kinetic Visual Novels are the purest novel adaptions. There are no choices in the game. You play the most canonical route envisioned by the author.

Global warming has reached its peak and has led to food shortages due to abnormal heat. Water and food were burned out by the heated atmosphere, later it became possible to grow something only in underground plantations. Therefore, people began to fight for a place under the sun. Local conflicts grew into global ones. The population of the Earth began to decrease rapidly, so various countries built 'Super fortresses&quot; - gigantic structures that penetrated deep into the earth. And in order to control the region, automatic turrets were placed that could autonomously carry out shifts even without people. In the end, the last global conflict with the use of nuclear weapons began, which led to the nuclear winter. This caused the planetary temperature to drop. And following the temperature, the population of humans as a species also decreased. Almost 85% of the potential was lost. All those who did not have shelters died immediately or after some time.

As a governess to the wealthy Mortimer family, Letitia devotes her humdrum days in London to the schooling of her pupil, Clara, to better mould her into the image of an ideal lady. Lurking beneath Letitia’s placid mannerisms, however, lay desires so intense they begin to unnerve her. As Clara matures, Letitia finds her feelings towards her maturing too – until, in the end, she can no longer bear it. Driven to distraction by Clara’s sensuous brown eyes and her sweet, seraphic laughter, Letitia soon begins to question her sanity. Fearful that, eventually, something within her might snap, and she will do something she regrets, Letitia is bidden to leave her former place of employment, and to seek out work elsewhere. Fortunately, Letitia soon discovers, in the pages of The Morning Post, a job offer which will grant her a means to escape her predicament. The Langley family are searching for a governess for their daughter, the unruly Genevieve – and, best of all, the family resides in the isolated Yorkshire moors, which seems as far away from London as it is possible to get. Upon reading this advertisement, Letitia soon decides to hand in her notice. She will travel to Yorkshire, become Genevieve’s governess, and then – God willing – she will be able to forget about Clara. Such was Letitia’s plan – but this plan, alas, soon goes horribly awry. Genevieve is not quite so young as Letitia first believed, and is, instead, a grown woman: already eighteen years of age. Genevieve is wilful and impetuous, but impossibly charming, and Letitia soon falls for her. As time passes, the two women get far closer than a governess and her pupil ought, and then… A story written by ebi-hime, the author of Blackberry Honey About 120k words of text (approx 4-8 hours of reading) A kinetic story with no choices/branches Detailed character and background artwork A custom OST A dramatic gothic romance story Suffering",

        "detailed_description": "Update Notes August 28th, 2023 Greetings! This update introduces lots of performance improvements, as well as an update to the game engine! [hr][/hr] We've improved performance on the experimental RWG map, as well as all the other maps. We've also improved performance with headlights and taillights as well. [hr][/hr] We've also update the trees on Njarovik. The trees now look better, and also perform better. With this update, we've also improved and polished the lighting. [hr][/hr] We have some important news for the players of the Project Speed game franchise. We have decided to change the games from Free to Play, to Paid. While we would have liked to keep the games free to play, we ultimately decided that it would be better in the long run to change them to paid to help fund their development better, since funding of development for the games has been at an all-time low. With this change, we hope to be able to work on the games in a higher capacity than we have been able to and to also be able to release more updates more frequently. It is important to note that those who received the game for free while it was Free to Play, will still have the game for free .

        "detailed_description": "This game is the passion project of a 16-year-old game dev who designed, programmed, and developed this game solo. Any support you give is greatly appreciated. The Reflection is a game that offers a brand new view on space and matter. The game explores the connection to an alternate dimension called The Reflection that contains all the matter of the world inverted. The portal to this dimension is characterized by a plane of water. From the surface, there appears to be simply a reflection of light, but submerging into the water reveals that this dimension is completely tangible, mirroring the world perfectly. Even moving objects and enemies are reflected, allowing players to interact with them from another angle (literally). Every aspect of the gameplay is carefully designed to utilize and expand the possibilities of The Reflection. Portals throughout the world enable the player to travel from a surface in The Reflection to its corresponding surface (now a ceiling) in the world. Some enemies exist in The Reflection and appear upside down in the world. Underwater sections of moving platforms disappear completely when reflected. The player also has a grappling ability that allows them to reach portals on the ceiling, which will become the floor once the player teleports to the corresponding surface in the world. Experience: • Mind-bending action situations: travel between the world and The Reflection to approach conflicts from a different angle, i.e. attack enemies from below by standing on the reflected ceiling above them (and below them in The Reflection) • Challenging precision gameplay: complex platforming sections and intense combat encounters, formulate plans to defeat enemies, utilize the reflected maps to gain an advantage over large groups of foes • Easy to read stylized graphics: experience a world with beautiful colors, accentuated with toon outlines and bright particle effects that pop for players to easily read and understand the level • Simple first-person shooter combat: defeat enemies in epic battles, repeatedly click or hold to fire, weapon ammo automatically regenerates (caps at 10) • 10 levels: progressively increasing in length and complexity (game length should last 2-5 hours depending on player skill) • Endless mode: unlocked when the 10 levels have been completed, large map with enemies swarming in from all sides",

This immersive experience sets you in the 1940's where legends of the game were making a name for themselves in spite of the oppositions set against them. Experience the story first hand as a player during this pivotal time in history. In this VR experience users will face certain struggles in playing the game of baseball during the time of racial segregation. This project is sure to be a hit for people of all ages as you face off with baseball legends such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and Buck Leonard. This project is a short narrative base experience allowing the players to use mechanics of the controllers to get a taste of playing baseball in the Negro Leagues. Practice your catching and throwing in the outfield. Take your place at bat and try to hit a home run. The VR experience weaves together historical narrative with entertaining game play to introduce you to a hidden chapter of America's past time. During game play you will explore some of the spaces and interact with people and places from the perspective of a Negro League baseball player. Through partnership with the Negro League Baseball Museum, funding from the Epic Games Mega Grant and partnership with Reallusion (the creators of iClone and Character Creator) we are bringing Negro League Baseball to life as they celebrate their 100th year anniversary.",

It’s not so easy, but luckily you meet up with lots of friends who help you, and afterwards you can play out a wide variety of stories with them: helping out at the riding stables, taking photos of birds, finding hidden treasures – apart from the thrilling main story, diverse experiences await you, too. Demonstrate your skill at elegant dressage, on the dusty Western riding grounds, in fast-paced obstacle-course races, at herding stubborn livestock, or at “Pop &amp; Gallop” while trying to improve your high score! Enjoy rides out in the open, lovingly designed world: Hazelwood, sunny beaches, autumn forests and dusky swamps, all the way to snow-capped mountains. Tend to your horse: feeding, washing, scraping out hooves or simply just an affectionate hug – your friendship and abilities will steadily grow. Design yourself and your horse to please you: With over a hundred unlockable pieces of clothing and customizations you can find a style all your own. Including completely dubbed texts in English and an original soundtrack by Winifred Phillips.",

        "detailed_description": "I HATE YOU, PLEASE SUFFER is a turn-based RPG of a woman doing a bunch of side quests to make rent while making new friends and fighting assorted weirdos. This game features: QUESTS! While there's different ways of making money, the biggest draw is doing the quests offered by the local adventuring guild. Maybe Ramona can make some friends in the process? FIGHTING! I HATE YOU PLEASE SUFFER is a standard turn-based RPG experience with some experimental things. Each party member distinguishes themself with a gimmick to keep things fresh, like Ramona risking some of her hard earned money to do moves, or Devon having to build up focus to use his magic attacks. There's enemy scaling, especially for bosses, so you can't just brute force your way through things! MONEY MAKING! Adventuring is just as respectable a job as any. Sell items you get from fighting people. Do the main quests. Hunt down the bounties of weird monsters and serial killers for the bounty office. Go fishing. Get a loan. Or maybe try to take the easy way out with some basic gambling minigames. INCONVENIENCES! The world is a mean place. Maybe you'll get inconvenienced by a random phone call while minding your business. Or some person you made angry will come up to start something. Such inconveniences are lovingly captured in this rude RPG. ------------ This is the BASIC version of the game, which contains about 3/5ths of what I originally pictured for the game. The COMPLETE version of the game, which will come out... one day... will be the fully realized experience that will be a commercial release. You may wonder, 'hey, why don't you just make this Early Access or something?&quot; Well, see, I'm bad at consistently focusing on things and I don't want to feel the pressure of delivering regular updates. So, everyone will just get the rest of the game all at once. The game contains about 3 - 5 hours of content and currently includes three party members. It also contains a bunch of rude stuff that'd probably make you mad. The music used in the game is all public domain stuff created by LOYALTY FREAK MUSIC. Go check out their work if you dig their vibes.",

        "detailed_description": "ABOUT THE GAME: 'Thieves’ Paradise' is a stealth-action heist game with a narrative-driven aspect. Players choose one of three storylines to participate in, stealing target items throughout an over-the-top shopping complex called Shopper's Paradise, at the behest of their chosen character or characters. Performance and player choices during the heists will alter NPC dialogue, and dialogue options can equally affect the heists. WELCOME TO SHOPPER'S PARADISE! In 'Thieves' Paradise', players will take control of the Thief, a poorly disguised man who has but one goal: break into Shopper's Paradise and steal what he needs. Shopper's Paradise is an elaborate mall-like shopping center filled with many different stores and 3 distinctly themed areas, each with their own lovable mascot! - Come listen to the gnarly tunes of Kevin the Lobster over in the Miami Vice area! - Let your kids come check out Sunset Sam the Gila Monster's play-pen and train ride over in the toy store by the Wild West area! - While the kids are gone, come relax near Tanuki Jones' Zen Garden in the Tokyo streets area! Each shop is designed from the ground up and filled with original props to create a world worth exploring for the player. Many shops will contain gadgets and tools for the player to use during their heists, which can be used as distractions or ways to trip pursuers. A STORY-DRIVEN NARRATIVE FILLED WITH MEMORABLE CHARACTERS! The narrative in 'Thieves' Paradise' is presented in a visual novel style. where the player will speak to one of three characters depending on the story they are presently on. The player's choices in the story matter, as it gives them a voice and can lead to different story paths depending on how the player chooses their dialogue. The player will explore three different stories, each filled with 3 different heists, as they learn more about the characters they interact with and just what kind of thief they really are. Each story focuses on a single main character besides the Thief, each with their own motives for requesting the Thief's talents. The narrative doesn't just stop after the cutscene ends! In addition to the visual novel segments 'Thieves' Paradise', the gameplay sections contain Radio Messages, which feature a character speaking directly to the Thief during their heists. The dialogue can range from help/advice as it serves as a tutorial for newer players, or it can just funny dialogue to endear some characters to the player and give the feeling that you have someone watching over your heists. YOUR HEISTS, YOUR RULES! The Thief will enter the Shopper's Paradise with a single goal: steal what they need. And it is up to the player to decide just how to go about accomplishing this. The player can choose to stealthily move through the level without getting caught by any of the guards or security cams, or they can go sprint through the level tripping up every guard they come across as they grab what they need and run out before they can get caught. Through reading the visual novel sections, the player will have an understanding of the main item they need to steal, as well as some side objectives that may appear. What the player decides to steal on some levels may actually affect the story based on their efforts! Each story contains multiple different endings the player can achieve through their choices both in narrative and in heists.

Each shop is designed from the ground up and filled with original props to create a world worth exploring for the player. Many shops will contain gadgets and tools for the player to use during their heists, which can be used as distractions or ways to trip pursuers. A STORY-DRIVEN NARRATIVE FILLED WITH MEMORABLE CHARACTERS! The narrative in 'Thieves' Paradise' is presented in a visual novel style. where the player will speak to one of three characters depending on the story they are presently on.

        "reviews": "“Dicefolk stands out in an otherwise stale and saturated genre by having one of the most addictive combat systems I’ve seen in a long time.” 9/10 – Way Too Many Games “Dicefolk is an intriguing take on the roguelike that gives you an unprecedented level of control over everything, and still makes you sweat in battle. It's cute, the replayability is very high, and it's got some fun progression unlocks as well. Definitely grab it if you're a turn-based roguelike person.” 9/10 – TheSixthAxis “I’ve spent tens of hours in Dicefolk already, and I have no doubt there’ll be many more to come. It elegantly builds upon its simple concept with fresh and increasingly complex considerations, making you feel like one more run will never be enough.” PCGamesN",

To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.",

        "detailed_description": "Boy, be the light that illuminates the world. The gospel of the beginning rings out in the land covered with despair. The 'Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible&quot; series incorporates the deep worldview of the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series with a touch of fantasy and is positioned as an outside story that is different from the previous series. This is a completely original work that could only be distributed and played on feature phones. The story takes place on Horus, a planet of despair infested with plague and magical beasts. Cain, the oppressive mad king, and Abel, the holy king, who tries to resist his oppressor. One day, the two kings make a declaration to their people. A boy's destiny is set in motion in a place unknown to anyone...

Everyone uses ChessBase, from the World Champion to the amateur next door. It is the program of choice for anyone who loves the game and wants to know more about it. Start your personal success story with ChessBase and enjoy the game even more. What you can do with ChessBase :Retrieve games according to openings, players and tournaments; generate tournament cross tables and full graphic statistics of players or openings; “Similarity search” shows all games with similar pawn structures, sacrifice patterns, endgame positions, etc.; “Let’s check”*: access the world’s largest database of in-depth analysis (more than 200 million positions); “Instant Analysis”: Any unannotated game is analysed almost without delay immediately on loading (optional). “Assisted Analysis”: as you enter a game, whenever you click on a piece an evaluation is produced for all its possible target squares; “Tactical Analysis” will annotate game, inserting commentary, variations and diagrams, before strong moves or errors, into a game or an entire database. It will also point out combinations, played in the game or missed, tries, attacks, initiative, and of course the latest in openings theory; Cloud analysis: you can analyse positions simultaneously with several engines from on di©erent computers running in parallel; “Deep analysis”: generates an analysis tree that changes dynamically, as with time weaker variations are dropped; automatic analysis jobs for correspondence games; “Replay Training”: Playing through a game with the notation hidden and automatic training questions with tips for each individual move. Extended reference search for openings shows increase/decrease in popularity and typical recurring endgames; merge games on the fly into an opening tree; Repertoire recommendations for every move with a single click; generate a dossier containing all available information on a specific player from the database; Preparation for opponents with recognition of their weaknesses; generate a comprehensive openings report with main and critical lines, plans and most important games; Urgent news about recently played innovations; Search for characteristic tactical positions in an opening variation single click publication of games on the Internet; Improved search mask with tactical motifs and examples for manoeuvres and material distribution; Completely new search booster for patterns and plans; print games in superb quality with diagrams and multiple columns; Crisp new 3D boards thanks to raytracing technology; access to the ChessBase online database with over eight million games* The most important innovations :ChessBase 17 focusses at things that, in our view, are the foremost of the program's areas of application. First of all, a lot of work has gone into functions that one only notices subconsciously, but which improve the user experience: the new ultra-high-resolution 2D board; the really crisp display of notation and lists through support of Direct 2D which runs on all recent Windows versions; and popular in more recent times: the 'Dark Mode&quot;. Technical improvements :Then there are many technical improvements that generally improve the program, such as: a new faster data format, with fewer files and no search booster - which overcomes limitations of the CBH format; and a fine-tuning of the database paths that solves conflicts with the Documents directory and OneDrive, so you can smoothly manage your databases outside the standard Windows directories. Interactive search mask and much more :The smart inputting of positions is of direct chess significance. You place a few pieces onto the board, and immediately see in which games of the reference database this position fragment occurs. By clicking on a game, you can save yourself the rest of the inputting. The new search mask is also more interactive: if you enter a search criterion, the number of games in the database for which it matches is immediately displayed. This way, you know what yield to expect before you click on &quot;OK&quot;. The new engine window :A lot has also been done in an area that is crucial for daily chess work: the engine window. Most ChessBase users probably spend 90% of their time with interactive analysis of positions. The output of engines has altered little in the last 30 years: variations, evaluations, dry as dust, done. In ChessBase 17, this has been fundamentally re-evaluated. The visual evaluation of pieces and measurement of complexity - you know from Fritz 18. The display of non-trivial threats or temptations is fancy, but also already familiar. The same goes for the training option to suppress the entire engine output, and only receive subtle tips as a stimulus to your own thinking. This is primarily intended for when watching live games. Analysis in natural language :However, the interpretation of an engine variation in natural language is groundbreakingly new. It is often a challenge for many players to imagine what is actually happening based on just an engine variation. You see the best move, the rating, and that's it. ChessBase 17 describes in words what the variation entails For example: In a super-sharp position, a complex variation has the strange rating &quot;0.00&quot;. ChessBase 17 would then add &quot;perpetual check&quot; or &quot;repetition of the position&quot; and the situation would become clear. Material changes are vividly described: &quot;White wins the queen for rook and knight&quot;; &quot;Black loses two pawns&quot;; and even &quot;The position is simplified into an endgame R+B vs R+N&quot;. There are also exciting statements like: &quot;White gains a dangerous passed pawn on e6&quot;; or &quot;White sacrifices a bishop&quot;; &quot;Black has an attack&quot;; &quot;White gets the majority on the kingside&quot;; &quot;Both kings are insecure&quot;; and &quot;Manoeuvre Nd2-f1-e3-d5&quot; etc. Such assertions clarify the motives behind a position. If you want to understand even more of what the program means by these hints, simply move the mouse over the move indicated and the position appears on the main board. Clicking on a move copies the variation up to that move into the notation, which then simplifies the commentary “The more colourful, the sharper” - or &quot;Death to the exclamation mark!&quot; :It does make a di'erence whether a position contains sharply forced variations, or several moves of almost equal value. Today's engines do not provide this information. ChessBase 17 therefore diverts a small part of the hardware resources towards a clone of the main engine, and calls this the &quot;Buddy engine&quot; - this only slightly impacts the computing power of the main engine. Buddy now goes over the variations, and analyses the position after each move. The variations are saved so that you can easily view them by moving your mouse cursor over on the move. Importantly, forced moves are annotated with coloured rectangles. The exclamation mark used in commenting on games for 170 years, doesn’t do justice to Buddy's search results; therefore, we now only use it for sacrifices The colour of the rectangles indicates the evaluation. The shape shows from which depth the forcing is recognised in the calculation. Trivial tactics have vertically divided rectangles. Medium forcing divides the rectangle into two triangles from top left to bottom right. Deep forcing divides diagonally from right to left. If the upper (or left) part is green, the move wins. If the lower part is yellow, for example, the position remains roughly in the draw range after the worse alternative move. If it is red, the alternative move loses. This system may seem complex at first glance, but it has the advantage that a lot of information is signalled in one space-saving symbol. The exclamation mark has had its day. In any case, one thing is clear: the more colourful, the more forcing! For years, we have recommended analysing with two engine variations, so that at least one forced main move can be recognised immediately. However, this costs a lot of additional computing time. ChessBase 17 marks the beginning of a renaissance of single-variation analysis. At the same time, the calculation goes much deeper. Buddy shows whether the first move is forced, and also provides the second variation. New in ChessBase 17: :- New data format: fewer files, more functions, more comfort, more speed. - Engine analysis renovated: Variants are automatically verbally annotated, forced continuations are recognized, “buddy heuristics” for greater search depth! - Pearl search: Find spectacular games instantly! Beautiful games are marked in the database list. - Optimised program interface: high-resolution 2D board, faster graphics. - New clearer search mask: material &amp; positional searches simplified, immediate feedback on expected results. - Intelligent position input: when setting up pieces, you are shown the games where those positions occur. - Dozens of detail improvements for improved usability, e.g. automatic loading of the last edited game. - Control via One-Drive: all database paths can be set in the options dialogue. - Newly structured game notation: with intelligent folding and symbols. - Modern integrated browser for all database texts. - More insight: Visualisation of attack correlations (optional). - Dark Mode: darkened program interface.",

Medium forcing divides the rectangle into two triangles from top left to bottom right. Deep forcing divides diagonally from right to left. If the upper (or left) part is green, the move wins. If the lower part is yellow, for example, the position remains roughly in the draw range after the worse alternative move. If it is red, the alternative move loses. This system may seem complex at first glance, but it has the advantage that a lot of information is signalled in one space-saving symbol. The exclamation mark has had its day. In any case, one thing is clear: the more colourful, the more forcing! For years, we have recommended analysing with two engine variations, so that at least one forced main move can be recognised immediately. However, this costs a lot of additional computing time. ChessBase 17 marks the beginning of a renaissance of single-variation analysis. At the same time, the calculation goes much deeper. Buddy shows whether the first move is forced, and also provides the second variation. New in ChessBase 17: :- New data format: fewer files, more functions, more comfort, more speed. - Engine analysis renovated: Variants are automatically verbally annotated, forced continuations are recognized, “buddy heuristics” for greater search depth! - Pearl search: Find spectacular games instantly! Beautiful games are marked in the database list. - Optimised program interface: high-resolution 2D board, faster graphics. - New clearer search mask: material &amp; positional searches simplified, immediate feedback on expected results. - Intelligent position input: when setting up pieces, you are shown the games where those positions occur. - Dozens of detail improvements for improved usability, e.g. automatic loading of the last edited game. - Control via One-Drive: all database paths can be set in the options dialogue. - Newly structured game notation: with intelligent folding and symbols. - Modern integrated browser for all database texts. - More insight: Visualisation of attack correlations (optional). - Dark Mode: darkened program interface.",

Without knowing, she'll become a summoner, bringing forces beyond anyone's control to this world. Will she be able to tame this lewd creature's sexual drive? Or will it be the other way around? Succubus Summon is a brand new eroge with multiple choices that affect the story, different endings, and high-quality 3D art that will cater to your kinks. If you're into Cum Inflation, Futanari Sex, and Dickgirls, this is the perfect game for you! Always looking for an adventure that ultimately leads to sex, Delphi finds herself dealing with magical powers that want the same thing! What happens to her will depend on how she handles the situation with the insatiable succubus she summons. Thirsting for any kind of sexual release, Kate is brought to our world by Delphi's accident, tying her to her summoner for as long as she remains on Earth. Will she obey Delphi?

This is important since the Peas have more than a few tricks up their sleeves to keep you on your toes, ranging from armour and defences, speed, and even circus cannons! Learn how these unique enemies interact with the terrain and your turrets, then do your best to keep them at bay no matter what. Unlike many others in the genres, the peas won't follow a set path and will actively find the best way to get to the tower. it’s up to you to build deadly mazes and find the best way possible to stop them from getting through. Different types of Peas may not be coming from the same direction, so choosing where and when to place your turrets will mean the difference between victory and defeat. Money is tight and you'll need to respond quickly to keep up with the huge variety of Peas heading your way. Prepare your defences using an accessible yet powerful building and upgrade system, giving you endless choices with how you survive and progress. Each turret has it's use, and a unique super upgrade will help it specialise even further.",

        "detailed_description": "WAR Card Game_uvr is a computer game version of the card game 'WAR&quot; but with a medieval theme. BACK STORY: You are an adventurer who is seeking a break from adventuring when you come across Ye Olde Inn and, when you go inside, you are challenged by the Oracle (the computer player) to a game of WAR. (Initially, you type in your first name so the game program can refer to you by printing your name on the screen and by speaking your name.) The Oracle suggests that you put your swords on the table and he conjures up a deck of cards for you to play with. GAME PLAY: Right-clicking on the tabletop (the area of the screen with the wooden texture) brings up the Start Menu Panel. Clicking the Start Game Button starts the game and splits the deck of cards. Right-clicking again brings up the Game Menu Panel. Clicking the Deal Cards Button deals a single card from both your cards and the Oracle's cards. Right-clicking yet again brings back up the Game Menu Panel. Clicking the Compare Cards Button determines who has the higher face value card and awards the cards to that player. If the cards are of equal face value, then there is a WAR. When a WAR happens, each player turns an additional card down and an additional card up. Then, the up cards are compared and whoever has the higher face value up card wins all cards dealt. If the up cards are of equal face value, then there is a WAR level 2 and the process is repeated. The dealing and comparing of cards continues until either one of the players wins all the cards or a player runs out of cards during a WAR. The player who runs out of cards during a WAR loses by default. FEATURES: -GAME DURATION, ROUNDS AND LEAD TRACKING: The game tracks how long you play, the number of rounds played and who is in the lead and by how many points. The Oracle tells you who's in the lead and by how much both by speaking to you and printing text on the screen. -AUTO-PLAY: The game has an auto-play feature that allows you to have the computer play out the game automatically either to the end of the game or until a WAR occurs. You can choose how rapidly the game is auto-played by setting the auto-play delay. The shorter the delay, the faster the game auto-plays. The auto-play delay slider decreases the delay when you slide it to the left and increases the delay when you slide it to the right. By default, the delay is set in the middle. -PAUSE: You can pause the game. The Pause Button is located at the bottom of the screen only while a game is playing. -SAVE AND LOAD GAME: You can save the game to finish playing another time. The saved game can be loaded by clicking the Load Game Button on the Start Menu Panel. There is a tool tip when you hover the mouse pointer over the Load Game or Save Game Button that tells you the date and time of when the game was saved. -PLAYER NAME SAVE: The game saves your name so you don't have to type it in every time. Your name can only be ten characters long. -CARD CONFIGURATION SAVE: The game also saves the configuration of the cards at the end of a game so the cards are more thoroughly shuffled the next time you play. -CARD SHUFFLING: To shorten the game and prevent the cards from just going back and forth between the players endlessly, the cards are shuffled not only at the beginning of the game but also when the cards each player has won are transferred to the cards each player is dealing from. You can hear when the cards are being shuffled. -ORACLE VOICE GENDER SELECTION: Also, you can choose the gender of the Oracle's voice in the Audio Menu.",

The main goal is to achieve the largest true highscore possible, but beware! The higher the score, the higher the difficulty. The spawned cubes are randomized and there are over 20 different cube types that can be spawned, provided certain in-game conditions are met. With randomization also comes the so-called probability hierarchy, with some cubes being so rare that you might not see one even after ten thousand cubes. Familiarizing yourself with the cube types also gains an advantage over randomly jumping on cubes. The gaps between the cubes ensure that precision in landing on to the platforms is crucial. Enemy elimination is also important, as you will see if you try this game... Note that spontaneous change of character skin is not possible, and you must change the skin manually if you want it to change. The same goes for backgrounds. Based on player feedback this can be subject to change, and spontaneous change especially for backgrounds might become a feature in the future. Soundtracks can change based on in-game conditions, but not all soundtracks are available this way, and some must be activated manually if one wants to listen to them. Some important, additional information : The enemies start to spawn after a score of 500 (one puzzle is to figure out how to get this score quite effortlessly), where enemy cubes (the cubes with an 'L' character in them) must be destroyed by jumping on them a number of times in order to get lives. Lives act as a shield against enemy projectiles (for example, the blood cubes), and are also needed to transform score into currency (2 lives per exchange) by jumping on the gray cubes with a peculiar symbol in them. The currency can then be used in the shop to alter the game in some ways. A boss cube can be summoned when the player reaches a score of 10k, and bosses start to automatically spawn after a score of 20k (the higher the score, the harder the bosses that can spawn).",

You use a camera to take photos to reveal the truth, to remember what was there. Your memory is fading; the longer things remain different, the faster you succumb. Keys to find, mysteries to solve, a home to explore. You need to keep your memory intact to put together pieces of your life and remember who you are and what has happened. Only then will you get the peace that you desire. During your play-through, you will need to study the layout of the home and what each room looks like. Over time, things will change and it is up to you to correct what changes in order to keep your sanity in tact. The more you let your sanity drain the more horror elements will occur and things that will change. If you let your sanity drain too far you will succumb and lose. There is no saving, a loss will end your play and you will need to restart. What you will be doing while playing: Take photos of objects that have changed to return them to normal and prevent sanity loss. Solve puzzles around the house to keep unlocking new rooms. Piece together story elements to progress the main story and discover what happened. Piecing together the entire story is how you win. Take pills to restore memory and keep your sanity in check. All puzzles, changing objects, horror elements and story elements are randomized on each play, allowing multiple plays to keep each play feeling different. A normal and hard difficulty setting, both difficulties unlocked from the start. Normal difficulty is meant to be an appropriate challenge, ramping up in difficulty the longer you play. Hard difficulty is meant to be very challenging, introducing many new things that can change, increased puzzle difficulty and less overall time. Statistics to track what you have accomplished and your best completed time for each difficulty.",

You play a lost lumberjack who is a frequent target of angry moose charges and general 'shenanigans&quot;. This isn't like real life where you can just move the moose crossing sign to get the moose to leave you alone. You must navigate your way around the moose (meese?), anger them, and get them to charge where you want them to go. While you're at it, have them charge into other moose and see what happens. You can hide behind trees and push blocks in front of the moose to stealthily sneak past. You can even load the moose onto rail carts to push them around. Whatever you do, don't get TRAMPLED. The moose aren't mean-spirited. They just don't like you. Mooselutions is a turn-based Sokoban style game, so you get one turn to get away from the moose after you anger them. Don't run into the path of an angry moose! There are forty nine hand-crafted moose puzzles designed to test your skills, and different areas unlock as you progress. Earn achievements for manipulating the moose to your whims and for being the target of their peskiness. Who would have thought such simple moose-related rules could lead to so many deep moose puzzles? This is what the moose call psychological pestering.",

Zippy Detective: Cats is a puzzle game where you explore an atmospheric city and try to find hidden cats. The objective of the game is to find the hidden cats located in different parts of the city, bring them to the area in front of the Eiffel Tower, and earn all the achievements in the game. Avoid flying ships and waiting geese that may chase you while trying to find the cats. Flying ships may snatch the cats you are after, making it harder for you to retrieve them. If you collide with geese, your screen will be covered in feathers and you may lose the game. When you find bones and give them to dogs, they will find a cat for you. Moreover, the customizable theme of the game provides players with the freedom to personalize their experience. Players can choose the theme that suits them best, in addition to the atmospheric environment, and customize their game experience. The four different theme options within the game provide players with a different atmospheric feel each time they play, offering them a unique experience every time. If you enjoy puzzle games such as 'Hidden Folks&quot; and &quot;A Building Full of Cats,&quot; then Zippy Detective: Cats may be the perfect option for you. So come on, find the hidden cats in the city and send them all to space by bringing them to the area in front of the Eiffel Tower!",

Forget talking to female quest givers, you're only allowed to go fight monsters after your mandated snuggling sessions, you'll never leave the house alone without Frei, Sara, or Leah close behind you! Thankfully your royal lineage is secured as these Yandere Witches have been practicing their nymphomancy and have prepped a hex to make sure your stamina is maxed out so you can go all night! Translated version of the original Japanese Visual Novel Frei, Sara, and Leah are fully voiced with original Japanese dialogue! Original artwork HD upscaled with 16:9 and 4:3 variants Hours of story content Audio including music and special effects Enhanced with character sprite animations Gallery and Scene selections 11 magical moments of ball draining sex spent with Yandere Witches!

Disgraced, a lone knight searches for revenge in a land ruled by bandits and corrupt knights. Fight through an unforgiving world filled with dangers and secrets. Die over and over again until your spirit is broken. Fulfill your lost oath, face your failures, avenge your master. This is a 2D side scroller platformer with both Souls-like and Rogue-like elements. You must keep fighting through the world until you reach your goal. If you die, you must start over. You can acquire randomized upgrades by defeating bosses or finding secret areas. You can also offer the lost souls you gather from killing enemies to the shrine of gods in order to upgrade your health, stamina, or damage. In battle, you have three defensive tools at your disposal. Block, backstep, and roll. You can block weaker attacks to leave an opening, you can back away from stronger ones, and roll past enemies while cornered.",

        "detailed_description": "This is a puzzle game that integrates principles from both nonogram and genetics. Game features: -Incorporates concepts from genetics such as genotype, phenotype, single gene inheritance, polygenic inheritance, and sex-linked inheritance into the game's -mechanics. -Revamps the gameplay of nonogram to make it compatible with genetic mechanisms. Common Questions: Q: Does the game require prior knowledge? A: You need to have a basic understanding of high school genetics. Q: How large is the game? A: The game consists of 32 levels each for single gene inheritance, multi-gene inheritance, and sex-linked inheritance, totaling 96 levels. It takes 4-12 hours to complete all levels. Q: Are the questions computer-generated? A: Yes, but all levels have been manually selected, eliminating questions that rely too heavily on enumeration. Almost every step in each level can be logically deduced. Q: Why are there settings like 'being your own offspring and parent&quot; and &quot;your parents being your offspring&quot;? A: These settings add new reasoning clues for sex-linked inheritance questions. Q: Any suggestions? A: Make good use of the annotation button, especially the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; buttons provided in sex-linked inheritance questions.",

        "detailed_description": "Bugs N' Guns is a cooperative third person shooter. Players take the role of Bugs and Guns two employees working as trash disposal for the crappiest company in the world. Tasked with finding and escorting a 'cargo&quot; train named MARC - OS that was lost in an alien environment players will need to work together to survive the hostile flora and fauna that will impede their path. COOPERATIVE The most important feature in Bugs N´ Guns is that this game requires two people to play. Not only is it impossible to play without another player but within the game all the challenges players will face require cooperation otherwise, defeat is assured. ONLINE- LAN In order to play this game players require an internet connection. Once inside the game player may choose to play either on LAN or by choosing to play with random people on a public match or playing with friends through private matchmaking. SHOOT AND COMBINE The main way players interact with the world of Bugs N´ Guns is through shooting. Shoot to protect, kill, and cooperate.

        "detailed_description": "A relaxing 1bit puzzle game set in a world where all the light is liquid. There are all sorts of creatures in the darkness, waiting for the light to bring them form, but no need to worry, they are quite tame. This puzzle game revolves around utilizing the liquid light and liquid dark to gain the curiosity and cooperation of the other creatures in the world. The Lightposts and Darkposts will be tools for your success, but with the help of the other creatures in the world, can you progress. While sometimes the creatures are covered in darkness and lack physical form, that can sometimes be advantageous as they no longer block the way. Sometimes though, you need a creature who's body is covered in light that allows it to take a physical form and help you cross gaps that would otherwise spell your doom. This is a puzzle game inspired by the classic game Lode Runner, but capitalizing on the puzzle aspect and downplaying the franticness of the game. The Creatures in the world also feature incredibly simple AI so they always do exactly what you intend for them to do. This game also features a level select which is accessible through the pause menu just in case you get hung up on one particular puzzle. Complete with 8-bit sound effects and peculiar creatures, this game is certain to tickle your brain! This game currently features: - 1 Tutorial - 16 Levels - Five Creature variants - Levers - Two Lamppost Variants - Light Platforms - Also a home screen... because of course",

        "reviews": "“A game in which the main character is ordered by the goddess to defeat the demon king as a way to make the store prosper, and goes on an adventure while having sex. The story is fairly light, so it can be enjoyed casually. The party is full of unique personalities, including a cheerful hero, a brave and pretentious hero, a strong but weak-minded dragon tribe, and a goddess who is mired in the world. The voices are gorgeous. I was entertained by the parodies in some places, although I wondered if they were okay.” 5.0 – ミミミョーリュ",

        "detailed_description": "' Prime &quot; is a board game inspired by chess and checkers. In the game, two opponents face off: the whites and the blacks. The game is played on a 64-square board, similar to that of chess. The pieces are marked with a number, which is added each time to the captured piece's number or increased by 1 or 2 units when the piece is promoted (reaching the opposite side of the board). Pieces with the number 1 are pawns and can move forward by only one square. Pieces with even numbers can move forward and sideways by only one square, while pieces with odd numbers can move forward and diagonally forward by only one square. Pieces with prime numbers starting from 5 can move in any direction (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal), provided the path is clear. Pawns, even-numbered pieces, and odd-numbered pieces are eligible for promotion when they reach the opposite side of the board: pawns and even-numbered pieces increase their value by one unit, while odd-numbered pieces increase by 2. After promotion, the direction of the piece is reversed. &quot;Prime&quot; pieces do not have a fixed direction as they can move in any direction (like the queen in chess). However, after capturing, if they become &quot;even&quot; or &quot;odd,&quot; they also inherit the direction of the captured piece. In the event that a &quot;Prime&quot; captures another &quot;Prime,&quot; the direction will be favorable to the side of the board closest to it. At the beginning of the game, each player has 8 pawns, 4 even-numbered pieces, 2 odd-numbered pieces, and 2 prime-numbered pieces. The player who captures all opponent pieces wins. The game can also end when both players possess only &quot;Prime&quot; pieces: in this case, the winner is determined by who has more pieces, and in case of a tie, the game is a draw or a tiebreaker.",

PREREQUISITE You'll need to know some math and a little trigonometry to get the most out of Height Lab. If you've written shaders before, then Height Lab should be a breeze to pick up since some of the concepts are the same.

Shahmaran brings the unique myth of the Shahmaran legend while keeping the original classic's epic gameplay untouched. Shahmaran moves around the map with original snake movement mechanics, picks up food to grow in size, and avoids colliding with her body parts and map edges. Fantastic Action Elements : Shahmaran has unique spells to overcome her enemies that spawn on the map. The Wail of Shahmaran is a devastating elemental scream that deals damage to enemies in the area where it was cast. Tornado of Souls is a mighty twister that traps enemies inside it upon collision. Demon Spirit is a powerful helper ally that fights enemies during its existence. Shahmaran's draconic tail attacks enemies in range with a powerful spit. Formidable Enemies : While Shahmaran picks up food to grow to her full size, scary enemies such as Worms, Spiders, and Mosquitoes constantly spawn on the map. They try to touch Shahmaran and attack her body parts to shrink her. Helpful Allies : While Shahmaran's head and tail deal damage to enemies with spells and weapons, she gains action points and can call Jamsab for help using these points. Jamsab flies to a designated location and drops a barrel filled with tar to slow down the enemies. Powered by Unreal Engine : Shahmaran was developed with Unreal Engine and supports all advanced graphical features such as hardware ray tracing, deferred shading, progressive LOD, etc.",
